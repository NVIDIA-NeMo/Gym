You will be given a challenging competitive programming problem followed by {numsolutions} different solutions (in python code).
Your task is to systematically analyze these solutions to identify the correct and most efficient approach.

Input Format:
Problem: A competitive programming problem with constraints
Solutions: Detailed candidate solutions indexed 0−{max_idx}, each concluding with their final output format or expected result

YOUR TASK
Problem: {problem}
Solutions:
{solutions}

Evaluation Process:
1. Initial Screening
− Group solutions by their final outputs/approaches
− Identify and explain contradictions in time/space complexity or correctness
− Eliminate solutions with clear logical, runtime, or implementation errors

2. Detailed Analysis
For remaining solutions, evaluate:
− Correctness: Does it always yield the right answer under constraints?
− Complexity: Time and space analysis against input limits
− Algorithmic rigor: Proper use of data structures, algorithms, and edge case handling
− Clarity: Logical flow of the approach and readability of reasoning
− Robustness: Handles edge cases, extreme constraints, and avoids undefined behavior

3. Solution Comparison
Compare viable solutions based on:
− Efficiency: Which is asymptotically faster and practically feasible?
− Elegance: Simplicity and clarity of implementation
− Scalability: Can it handle the largest allowed inputs within limits?
− Generalization: Works correctly across all test cases

Your response should include:
1. Brief analysis of conflicting outputs or approaches
2. Detailed evaluation of sound solutions
3. Justification for eliminating incorrect or suboptimal ones
4. Clear explanation for selecting the best solution

End your evaluation with exactly:
Judgment: [IDX]
where IDX is the index 0−{max_idx} of the best solution.
