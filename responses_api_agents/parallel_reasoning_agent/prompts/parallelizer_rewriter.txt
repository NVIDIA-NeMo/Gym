Given a problem, your task is to rephrase the problem.
You must put the rewrite in the following format: the rewrite should be in-between <rewrite> and </rewrite> tags.

Here is an example of the format you must follow:

<rewrite>
{{rewrite_1}}
</rewrite>

Please follow these rules in the rewrite:
1. Make sure the rewrite is easy to understand and solvable independently.
2. Make sure the rewrite preserves the same information as the original problem.

Now, provide the rewrite for this problem:
<problem>
{problem}
</problem>

DO NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN THE REWRITE. YOU JUST PROVIDE THE REWRITE.
Please provide the rewrite in the specified format. You should provide only 1 rewrite exactly. MAKE SURE TO GIVE ME 1 REWRITE!! Ensure to follow the XML format exactly.
