Given a problem, your task is to think carefully about the problem and come up {num_plans} unique and diverse plans.
Each plan should be a step-by-step strategy that a downstream solver model can execute.
Return each plan in XML between <plan> and </plan> tags.

Response format:
<plan>
{{plan 1}}
</plan>
<plan>
{{plan 2}}
</plan>
<plan>
{{plan n}}
</plan>

Rules for the plan:
1. Do not specific the plan number, such as "Plan 1", "Plan 2", etc.
2. Include as much detail as possible in the plan.
3. Each plan can be used independently to solve the problem.
4. Name key variables explicitly and note the formulas to be used.
5. Select a high-level method and outline the path from the given information to the solution.

Now, provide the plans for this problem:
<problem>
{problem}
</problem>

Provide exactly {num_plans} plans. Ensure to follow the XML format exactly.
