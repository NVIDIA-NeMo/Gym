Given a problem, your task is to create a reasoning strategy or solution plan.

Be creative and diverse in your approach - you can use any reasoning template that makes sense for the problem.
The only requirement is that your plan must be enclosed in XML tags: <plan> and </plan>.

Rules:
1. Do not compute, simplify, or give the final answer.
2. Focus on outlining the reasoning approach, not executing it.
3. Be creative - there are many valid ways to approach a problem.

Now, provide a plan for this problem:
<problem>
{problem}
</problem>
