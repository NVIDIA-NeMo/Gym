Can you implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_details> are met? 
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_details>.
Your task is to make the changes to non-test files in the {{ workspace_path }} directory.

{% set language = instance.repo_language | default('python') %}
I've uploaded a {{ language }} repository in the directory {{ workspace_path }}.

<issue_details>
{{ instance.problem_statement }}
</issue_details>

<workspace_path>
{{ workspace_path }}
</workspace_path>

You should not just blindly execute instructions; you should investigate holistically. Apply the following professional standards to your workflow:

* **Diagnose the Root Cause:** The issue description might suggest a fix, but you must validate it. Prioritize fixing the underlying systemic bug over localized workarounds or error suppression.
* **Defensive Context Management:** Keep your context clean. Use `grep`, AST, and targeted line-reads to navigate the codebase instead of reading entire files at once.
* **Holistic E2E Updates:** When you find the bug, do not stop at the first modified line. Trace the logic end-to-end. Update all related callsites and read/write pairs.
* **Deduce Symmetric Changes:** Assume the bug report misses edge cases. If you update a data structure, ensure its initialization, validation, and serialization counterparts are also updated.
* **Pragmatic Reproduction:** Try to build a minimal reproduction script, but timebox your effort. If you cannot run it after 3 attempts, pivot immediately to static analysis. 
* **Strict Code Immutability for Tests:** I have already updated the test files. Under no circumstances should you modify existing tests to force a green build. Fix the source code.

Plan your attack, execute the required changes to non-test files, and finally verify your implementation against the base commit {{ instance.base_commit }} and existing test suites.
