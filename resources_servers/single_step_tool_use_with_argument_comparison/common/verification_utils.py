        how much credit an admissible response earns:

        - `binary_strict` — 1.0 only if every required call matched, else 0.0.
        - `fractional` — the matched fraction of the required calls. Surplus calls permitted by
          `allow_superset` are free, so this rewards recall but not precision.
        - `f1` — the harmonic mean of precision and recall, `2 * matched / (expected + actual)`. Missing
          and surplus calls are penalized symmetrically, so a response only reaches 1.0 by matching the
