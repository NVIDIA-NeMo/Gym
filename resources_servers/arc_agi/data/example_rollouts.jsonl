So, the problem is about generating a 2D array based on some input values. Let's look at the examples given to understand the pattern.\n\nFirst, looking at Example 1:\n\nInput is:\n8 6\n6 4\n\nOutput is a 6x6 grid. Let me break it down. The output has six rows. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 1: 8 6 8 6 8 6\nRow 2: 6 4 6 4 6 4\nRow 3: 6 8 6 8 6 8\nRow 4: 4 6 4 6 4 6\nRow 5: 8 6 8 6 8 6\nRow 6: 6 4 6 4 6 4\n\nHmm. So the first two rows are the input pairs repeated. Then the third row is 6 8... which is swapping the first two numbers. Then the fourth row is 4 6... which is swapping the second pair. Then it repeats again the first two rows?\n\nWait, the input is two pairs: first line is 8 6, second line is 6 4. So maybe the output is constructed by repeating these pairs in some pattern. Let me see the output rows:\n\nLooking at the output rows, there are six rows. Let me check the pattern:\n\nRow 1: 8 6 repeated three times (since 8 6 8 6 8 6)\nRow 2: 6 4 repeated three times\nRow 3: 6 8 repeated three times (swap the first pair)\nRow 4: 4 6 repeated three times (swap the second pair)\nRow 5: same as row 1\nRow 6: same as row 2.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that for each of the two input pairs, they are repeated three times in their own rows, then swapped and repeated again. Then the same sequence repeats again. Wait, but why are there six rows? The input has two pairs. Maybe the output is 6 rows because each pair is used in two different ways, and then repeated?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the two input pairs and creating a sequence of rows that alternate between the original and swapped versions, and then repeat them.\n\nAnother example: Example 2's input is 7 9 and 4 3. The output is:\n\n7 9 7 9 7 9\n4 3 4 3 4 3\n9 7 9 7 9 7\n3 4 3 4 3 4\n7 9 7 9 7 9\n4 3 4 3 4 3\n\nSame pattern. So the first two rows are the original pairs, then the next two rows are swapped, then again the original pairs. So for two input pairs, the output has 6 rows? Wait, the output here is 6 rows. Let me count: in example 1, the output has 6 rows. So the number of rows is 6. So the output is 6 rows, each with 6 elements (since the input pairs are two numbers, and each row has 6 elements, which is 3 repetitions of the pair).\n\nSo the pattern is that for each input pair, there are two rows: the original and the swapped. Then this is repeated twice? Or maybe the number of rows is 6, which is 2 pairs multiplied by 3? Or maybe the output has 6 rows, each with 6 elements, and the pattern is that the first two rows are the original pairs, then the next two rows are swapped, then the first two again?\n\nBut in example 1, after the first two rows, the third row is the swapped version of the first pair (6 8), fourth row is swapped version of the second pair (4 6). Then fifth row is the original first pair again, sixth is original second pair again.\n\nSo the sequence is: original pair 1, original pair 2, swapped pair 1, swapped pair 2, original pair 1, original pair 2. Then the same pattern repeats?\n\nWait, but in example 1, the output has 6 rows. So the pattern is:\n\nRow 1: pair1 repeated 3 times (so 8 6 8 6 8 6)\nRow 2: pair2 repeated 3 times (6 4 6 4 6 4)\nRow 3: swapped pair1 (6 8) repeated 3 times (6 8 6 8 6 8)\nRow 4: swapped pair2 (4 6) repeated 3 times (4 6 4 6 4 6)\nRow 5: same as row1\nRow 6: same as row2.\n\nSo the pattern is that the first two rows are the original pairs, then the next two rows are the swapped pairs, then the first two rows again. But why?\n\nBut why does it repeat? Because the output has 6 rows. So for the input pairs, the output has 6 rows. So for each input pair, the output has 3 rows? Or maybe it's the number of rows equals 2 * 3? Not sure.\n\nBut the key is that each row is a repetition of the pair, either original or swapped, and the pattern of the rows is original pair 1, original pair 2, swapped pair 1, swapped pair 2, original pair 1, original pair 2.\n\nSo for the test case, the input is:\n\n3 2\n7 8\n\nSo the two input pairs are (3,2) and (7,8). So following the same pattern as the examples, the output should be:\n\nRow 1: 3 2 repeated 3 times \u2192 3 2 3 2 3 2\nRow 2: 7 8 repeated 3 times \u2192 7 8 7 8 7 8\nRow 3: swapped pair1 (2 3) repeated 3 times \u2192 2 3 2 3 2 3\nRow 4: swapped pair2 (8 7) repeated 3 times \u2192 8 7 8 7 8 7\nRow 5: same as row 1 \u2192 3 2 3 2 3 2\nRow 6: same as row 2 \u2192 7 8 7 8 7 8\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[\n[3,2,3,2,3,2],\n[7,8,7,8,7,8],\n[2,3,2,3,2,3],\n[8,7,8,7,8,7],\n[3,2,3,2,3,2],\n[7,8,7,8,7,8]\n]\n\nBut let me check the examples again to make sure. For example 1, the third row is 6 8 6 8 6 8, which is swapped first pair (original was 8 6). Similarly, the fourth row is 4 6... which is swapped second pair (original was 6 4). Then fifth row is again original first pair, sixth original second.\n\nSo yes, the pattern is that the first two rows are original pairs, then next two rows are swapped pairs, then first two again. So the output is 6 rows. Therefore, for the test case, the same applies.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n[\n[3,2,3,2,3,2],\n[7,8,7,8,7,8],\n[2,3,2,3,2,3],\n[8,7,8,7,8,7],\n[3,2,3,2,3,2],\n[7,8,7,8,7,8]\n]\n\nNow I need to present this as a 2D array in the specified format.

So, the task is to generate a 2D array based on the given input. Let's look at the examples provided.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is 8 6 and 6 4. The output is a 6x6 grid. Wait, the input has two lines, each with two numbers. The output has six rows. Let me check the output structure.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output:\n\nRow 1: 8 6 8 6 8 6\nRow 2: 6 4 6 4 6 4\nRow 3: 6 8 6 8 6 8\nRow 4: 4 6 4 6 4 6\nRow 5: 8 6 8 6 8 6\nRow 6: 6 4 6 4 6 4\n\nHmm, so the first two rows are the original input pairs repeated. Then the next two rows seem to be swapping the numbers? Like row 3 is 6 8... which is the reverse of the first input line (8 6). Then row 4 is 4 6... which is the reverse of the second input line (6 4). Then rows 5 and 6 repeat the first two rows again. Wait, but the output has six rows. The input has two lines, but the output has six rows. So maybe there's a pattern of repeating the input pairs and their reversed versions?\n\nSimilarly, Example 2's input is 7 9 and 4 3. The output has six rows again. Let's check:\n\nRow 1: 7 9 7 9 7 9\nRow 2: 4 3 4 3 4 3\nRow 3: 9 7 9 7 9 7\nRow 4: 3 4 3 4 3 4\nRow 5: 7 9 7 9 7 9\nRow 6: 4 3 4 3 4 3\n\nSame pattern. The first two rows are the original pairs, then the next two are reversed, then repeat again. So the output has 6 rows. Wait, the input has two lines, and the output has 6 rows. So perhaps the number of rows is 6, regardless of input? Or maybe it's based on the input numbers? Let me think.\n\nWait, looking at the input for example 1: the first line is 8 6, the second line is 6 4. The output has 6 rows. The same for example 2. So maybe the output has 6 rows regardless of the input. But why 6?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of rows is determined by the sum of the input numbers? Let me check. For example 1: 8+6=14, 6+4=10. Not sure. But the output has 6 rows. Maybe the output has 6 rows because each of the input pairs is repeated 3 times? Like for example 1, the first two rows are the original pairs, then the next two are reversed, then again the original. But that would be 6 rows. Wait, in example 1, the output has 6 rows. Let's count:\n\nRows 1-2: original pairs (8 6 and 6 4)\nRows 3-4: reversed pairs (6 8 and 4 6)\nRows 5-6: original pairs again (8 6 and 6 4)\n\nSo the pattern is: for each of the input lines, repeat them twice, then reverse them and repeat twice, then repeat original again? Or maybe it's a cycle of the original and reversed pairs.\n\nBut the output is 6 rows. So for each input pair, maybe the output has 3 copies? Or perhaps the number of rows is 6, and each row is a repetition of the input pairs in some order.\n\nBut what about the columns? Each row has 6 elements. For example 1, the first row is 8 6 repeated three times. So 8 6 8 6 8 6. Similarly, the second row is 6 4 repeated three times. Then the third row is 6 8 repeated three times. Fourth row is 4 6 repeated three times. Then fifth row is 8 6 again, and sixth is 6 4 again.\n\nSo the pattern is that each row alternates between the original pairs and their reversed versions, and each row is repeated three times. Wait, but the first row is original, second is original, then third is reversed, fourth is reversed, fifth is original, sixth is original? Or maybe it's a cycle of 4 rows? Let me check.\n\nIn example 1, the first two rows are the original input pairs. Then the next two rows are the reversed pairs. Then the next two rows are original again. So the pattern is original, original, reversed, reversed, original, original. But why?\n\nBut why would that be the case? Maybe the output is constructed by taking the original pairs and their reversed versions, and then arranging them in a certain way. Let me think about the test input.\n\nThe test input is 3 2 and 7 8. Let me apply the same pattern.\n\nSo the original pairs are:\n\nFirst line: 3 2\n\nSecond line: 7 8\n\nSo the output would have 6 rows. Let's think:\n\nRow 1: 3 2 repeated three times \u2192 3 2 3 2 3 2\n\nRow 2: 7 8 repeated three times \u2192 7 8 7 8 7 8\n\nRow 3: reverse of first line \u2192 2 3 repeated three times \u2192 2 3 2 3 2 3\n\nRow 4: reverse of second line \u2192 8 7 repeated three times \u2192 8 7 8 7 8 7\n\nRow 5: original first line again \u2192 3 2 3 2 3 2\n\nRow 6: original second line again \u2192 7 8 7 8 7 8\n\nBut wait, in the examples, the third row is the reversed first line, and the fourth row is the reversed second line. Then the fifth and sixth rows are the original again. So that's the pattern.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow 1: 3 2 3 2 3 2\n\nRow 2: 7 8 7 8 7 8\n\nRow 3: 2 3 2 3 2 3\n\nRow 4: 8 7 8 7 8 7\n\nRow 5: 3 2 3 2 3 2\n\nRow 6: 7 8 7 8 7 8\n\nBut wait, in the first example, the first two rows are the original input lines. Then the third and fourth are reversed. Then fifth and sixth are original again. So the pattern is that the output is:\n\nOriginal line 1, original line 2, reversed line 1, reversed line 2, original line 1, original line 2.\n\nBut in the first example, the output rows are:\n\nRow 1: 8 6 8 6 8 6 (original line 1 repeated three times)\n\nRow 2: 6 4 6 4 6 4 (original line 2)\n\nRow 3: 6 8 6 8 6 8 (reversed line 1: 6 8)\n\nRow 4: 4 6 4 6 4 6 (reversed line 2: 4 6)\n\nRow 5: 8 6 8 6 8 6 (original line 1 again)\n\nRow 6: 6 4 6 4 6 4 (original line 2 again)\n\nSo the pattern is: for each of the two input lines, we have two copies in the output. Then, for the reversed lines, two copies. Then again the original lines. So the order is:\n\nOriginal line 1, original line 2, reversed line 1, reversed line 2, original line 1, original line 2.\n\nBut why is that the case? Maybe the output is structured in such a way that for each of the input lines, they are repeated twice, then their reversed versions are repeated twice, then the original lines again. But the exact order is important.\n\nSo for the test input, the input is:\n\nFirst line: 3 2\n\nSecond line: 7 8\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow 1: 3 2 3 2 3 2\n\nRow 2: 7 8 7 8 7 8\n\nRow 3: 2 3 2 3 2 3 (reversed first line)\n\nRow 4: 8 7 8 7 8 7 (reversed second line)\n\nRow 5: 3 2 3 2 3 2\n\nRow 6: 7 8 7 8 7 8\n\nSo the 2D array would be:\n\n[\n [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2],\n [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8],\n [2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3],\n [8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7],\n [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2],\n [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]\n]\n\nBut wait, in the examples, the reversed lines are in the third and fourth rows. So for example 1, the third row is the reversed first line (6 8), fourth row is reversed second line (4 6). Then the fifth and sixth rows are original again. So yes, that's the pattern.\n\nSo applying that to the test case, the output would be as above. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nAnother thing to note: each row is a repetition of the pair three times. For example, in example 1's first row, 8 6 is repeated three times. So the length of each row is 6 elements. So for the test input, each row would have 6 elements. So the first row is 3 2 repeated three times, which is 3 2 3 2 3 2. Similarly for others.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be a 6x6 2D array as described.\n", "type": "summary_text"}], "type": "reasoning", "encrypted_content": null}, {"id": "msg_a6364ae5fa274870acc08ed2468edd90", "content": [{"annotations": [], "text": "\n\nThe given problem involves generating a specific 2D array based on a pattern derived from the input.

So, the task is to generate a 2D array based on the given input. Let's look at the examples provided.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is 8 6 and 6 4. The output has six rows. Wait, let me check. The output for Example 1 is:\n\n8 6 8 6 8 6\n6 4 6 4 6 4\n6 8 6 8 6 8\n4 6 4 6 4 6\n8 6 8 6 8 6\n6 4 6 4 6 4\n\nSo each row is six elements long. Wait, but how does that relate to the input? The input has two pairs: 8 6 and 6 4. The output seems to have rows that alternate between the two pairs, but maybe in a certain pattern. Let me count the rows. There are 6 rows. Hmm, maybe the number of rows is determined by the sum of the numbers in the input? Let's see: 8+6=14, 6+4=10. No, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe it's the product of the two numbers? 8*6=48, which is way larger. Not sure.\n\nLooking at the output rows. The first two rows are 8 6 repeated three times (since 8 6 is two numbers, multiplied by 3 gives 6 elements). Then the next two rows are 6 4 repeated three times. Then the next two rows are 6 8 and 4 6? Wait, the third row is 6 8 6 8 6 8. So that's 6 8 repeated three times. Then the fourth row is 4 6 4 6 4 6. Then again the first two rows repeat. So the pattern seems to be that the output has 6 rows. Let me check the input for example 1: the first line is 8 6, second line is 6 4. So maybe the output is generated by taking the original pairs and their reversed versions, and then repeating them in some order?\n\nLooking at the output rows:\n\nRow 1: 8 6 repeated 3 times (so 8 6 8 6 8 6)\nRow 2: 6 4 repeated 3 times\nRow 3: 6 8 repeated 3 times (which is the reverse of the first pair)\nRow 4: 4 6 repeated 3 times (reverse of the second pair)\nRow 5: same as row 1\nRow 6: same as row 2\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that for each pair, we have two rows: the original and the reversed, and then they are repeated. But why are there 6 rows? Let's see: the first pair is 8 6. Then the second pair is 6 4. So maybe the number of rows is 2 * (number of input pairs) * something? Wait, there are two input pairs, but the output has 6 rows. So maybe the number of rows is 2 * (some number). Alternatively, maybe the number of rows is 6 because the input numbers are 8 and 6, and 6 is the second number. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output has 6 rows because each of the input pairs is repeated 3 times. Let me think. For example, in example 1, the input pairs are (8,6) and (6,4). The output has 6 rows. Each row is 6 elements. So the output is 6 rows by 6 columns. Wait, the output for example 1 has 6 rows, each with 6 elements. So how is that generated?\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRows 1 and 2 are the original pairs, each repeated three times. Then rows 3 and 4 are the reversed pairs, each repeated three times. Then rows 5 and 6 repeat rows 1 and 2 again. So the pattern is: for each of the two input pairs, we have two rows (original and reversed) and then they are repeated. But why three times? Wait, the length of each row is 6. Each pair is two numbers. So 2 numbers multiplied by 3 gives 6 elements. So each row is the pair repeated 3 times.\n\nSo for the input, there are two pairs. For each pair, we generate two rows: one with the original pair repeated three times, and another with the reversed pair repeated three times. Then, these are repeated again? Wait, but in example 1, there are 6 rows. So for two input pairs, each contributing two rows, that would be 2*2=4 rows. But example 1 has 6 rows. Hmm, maybe there's another pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the two input pairs and then generating a sequence of rows where each row is a combination of the pairs and their reverses, and then repeating them. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the test input for example 1, the output has 6 rows. Let's count the number of rows for each example. Example 1 has 6 rows, example 2 also has 6 rows. Let's check example 2's input:\n\nInput is 7 9 and 4 3. Output has 6 rows. So the number of rows is 6 regardless of the input. So maybe the output is always 6 rows. Then each row is 6 elements. So the output is a 6x6 grid.\n\nBut how to generate each row?\n\nLooking at example 1's output:\n\nRow 1: 8 6 8 6 8 6\nRow 2: 6 4 6 4 6 4\nRow 3: 6 8 6 8 6 8\nRow 4: 4 6 4 6 4 6\nRow 5: 8 6 8 6 8 6\nRow 6: 6 4 6 4 6 4\n\nSo the pattern here is that the first two rows are the original pairs, repeated three times. Then the next two rows are the reversed pairs, repeated three times. Then the first two rows again. So the sequence is: original pair, reversed pair, original pair, reversed pair, original pair, reversed pair? No, because rows 1 and 2 are original, then rows 3 and 4 are reversed, then rows 5 and 6 are original again. So the pattern is that for each of the two input pairs, we have two rows: original and reversed, and then they are repeated again. But how many times? For example, in example 1, the first pair (8,6) is in rows 1, 5, and then again? Wait, row 5 is same as row 1. So maybe each pair is repeated three times? But there are 6 rows. So for each pair, two rows (original and reversed) and they are repeated three times? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each row alternates between the original and reversed pairs. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the rows:\n\nRow 1: (8,6) repeated 3 times.\nRow 2: (6,4) repeated 3 times.\nRow 3: (6,8) repeated 3 times (which is the reverse of 8,6)\nRow 4: (4,6) repeated 3 times (reverse of 6,4)\nRow 5: (8,6) again\nRow 6: (6,4) again.\n\nSo the pattern is that for each of the two input pairs, we have two rows: the original and the reversed, and then they are repeated again. So the total rows are 2 (original and reversed) multiplied by 2 (number of input pairs) = 4 rows? But example 1 has 6 rows. So this doesn't fit. Wait, maybe for each of the two input pairs, we have three rows? But that doesn't fit either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the first pair and the second pair, then alternating them. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of rows is determined by the sum of the two numbers in the input. Let's check example 1: 8+6=14, 6+4=10. Not sure. But the output has 6 rows. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the pattern in the output. Each row is a repetition of a two-element pair. For example, row 1 is 8 6 repeated three times. So the length of each row is 6 elements. Which is 2*3. So for each row, the pair is repeated 3 times. So the number of repetitions is 3. Why 3?\n\nIn the first example, the input pairs are 8 6 and 6 4. The output has 6 rows. Let's see: 6 rows divided into 2 pairs (original and reversed) for each of the two input pairs. But that would be 2 pairs * 2 rows each = 4 rows. But there are 6 rows. So maybe the number of rows is 2 * 3? Or 3 * 2?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of rows is determined by the maximum of the two numbers in the input? For example, in example 1, the input numbers are 8, 6, 6, 4. The maximum is 8. But output has 6 rows. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input given for the problem: the test input is 3 2 and 7 8. The output needs to be generated. So perhaps for the test case, the output is 6 rows, each with 6 elements, following the same pattern as the examples.\n\nSo, for the test input, the two pairs are (3,2) and (7,8). Let's try to generate the output rows based on the pattern observed in examples.\n\nIn example 1, the first two rows are the original pairs, then the next two are the reversed pairs, then the first two again. So for the test case, maybe:\n\nRow 1: (3,2) repeated three times \u2192 3 2 3 2 3 2\nRow 2: (7,8) repeated three times \u2192 7 8 7 8 7 8\nRow 3: (2,3) reversed of (3,2) \u2192 2 3 2 3 2 3\nRow 4: (8,7) reversed of (7,8) \u2192 8 7 8 7 8 7\nRow 5: same as row 1 \u2192 3 2 3 2 3 2\nRow 6: same as row 2 \u2192 7 8 7 8 7 8\n\nBut wait, in the examples, after rows 1-2, they have rows 3-4, then rows 5-6 as the same as 1-2. So that's the pattern. So the output would be:\n\n[\n[3,2,3,2,3,2],\n[7,8,7,8,7,8],\n[2,3,2,3,2,3],\n[8,7,8,7,8,7],\n[3,2,3,2,3,2],\n[7,8,7,8,7,8]\n]\n\nBut wait, let me check example 2. Example 2's input is 7 9 and 4 3. Output:\n\n7 9 7 9 7 9\n4 3 4 3 4 3\n9 7 9 7 9 7\n3 4 3 4 3 4\n7 9 7 9 7 9\n4 3 4 3 4 3\n\nSo the pattern here is similar. The first two rows are the original pairs, then reversed, then original again. So yes, same pattern. So for the test case, the answer would be as I outlined.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other pattern. For example, maybe the order of the pairs is different. Like, in example 1, the first pair is (8,6), then (6,4). But in the output, the first two rows are (8,6) and (6,4). Then the next two are reversed of those. But in example 2, the first pair is (7,9), then (4,3). The output's first two rows are (7,9) and (4,3), then their reverses. So the same pattern.\n\nSo for the test case, the input pairs are (3,2) and (7,8). So the output rows would be:\n\nRow 1: 3 2 repeated three times \u2192 3 2 3 2 3 2\nRow 2: 7 8 repeated three times \u2192 7 8 7 8 7 8\nRow 3: 2 3 repeated three times \u2192 2 3 2 3 2 3\nRow 4: 8 7 repeated three times \u2192 8 7 8 7 8 7\nRow 5: same as row 1\nRow 6: same as row 2\n\nSo the final 2D array is:\n\n[\n[3,2,3,2,3,2],\n[7,8,7,8,7,8],\n[2,3,2,3,2,3],\n[8,7,8,7,8,7],\n[3,2,3,2,3,2],\n[7,8,7,8,7,8]\n]\n\nBut let me check if there's any other pattern. For example, in the examples, the rows are arranged as original pair, then the second pair, then reversed first pair, reversed second pair, then original pair again, then second pair again. So for the test case, the same pattern applies.\n\nYes, that seems to fit. So the answer should be as above. Let me make sure that each row is 6 elements. Each of the rows is 3 repetitions of the pair, which is 2*3=6 elements. Correct.\n\nSo the final answer is the 6x6 array as above. Therefore, the boxed answer would be:\n\n\\boxed{[[3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8], [2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], [8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7], [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]]}\n", "type": "summary_text"}], "type": "reasoning", "encrypted_content": null}, {"id": "msg_f89006e8cebd4b39a06cfdad678e6835", "content": [{"annotations": [], "text": "\n\nTo solve this task, we analyze the pattern in the provided examples.

So, the task is to transform the input grid into the output grid based on some pattern observed from the examples. Let me look at the examples given.\n\nLooking at the first example, the input has a bunch of 8s and a single 1. The output replaces the 8s with 2s and the 1 with 0? Wait, no. Wait, the output has 2s where the 8s were, and the 1 in the input becomes 0? Or maybe not. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the first example, the input has a 1 in the 10th row (if counting from 0?), and the output has 0s there. But looking at the output, the 1 in the input is replaced with 0? Or maybe the 1 is part of some structure that's being transformed. But maybe the pattern is that the numbers are being replaced with some value based on their position relative to the 1s or 8s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are being replaced with numbers based on their proximity to the 1s. For example, in example 1, the output has 2s where the 8s were, and the 1 is replaced with 0. But maybe the 1 is the source, and the 8s are being replaced with numbers based on their distance from the 1? Or perhaps the 8s are part of a structure that's being transformed into a different number, like 2, and the 1 is replaced with 0. But that doesn't hold for all examples. Let me check another example.\n\nIn example 2, the input has 1s and 8s. The output replaces 8s with 3s and the 1s with 0s. Wait, the input has a 1 in the 10th row (assuming rows are 0-indexed?), and in the output, that area is 0s. So maybe the 1s are being replaced with 0s, and the 8s are replaced with numbers corresponding to their distance from the 1s? Or maybe the 8s are part of a structure that's being transformed into a number based on their position relative to the 1s.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 8s are being replaced with numbers that represent the number of steps to reach the nearest 1. But looking at example 1, the 1 is in a certain position. Let's imagine that the output numbers are the distance from the nearest 1. But in example 1, the output has 2s. Let me check.\n\nWait, in example 1, the input has a 1 in the 10th row (assuming rows are 0-indexed?), but the output has 2s in some positions. But maybe the numbers are the count of how many 8s are connected to the 1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced with the count of 8s in their vicinity. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nLooking at the outputs, for example 1, the output has 2s where the 8s were. In example 2, the 8s are replaced with 3s. In example 3, 8s are replaced with 2s. In example 4, 8s are replaced with 7s. And example 5 has 3s. So the output numbers seem to vary depending on the input. So maybe the output numbers are the number of 8s in the original input, but that doesn't make sense. For example, in example 1, the input has a lot of 8s. But the output has 2s. So maybe each 8 is replaced with a number that depends on the position of the 1 in the input.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the 1s in the input are the centers, and the 8s are being replaced with numbers that represent their distance from the 1. For instance, in example 1, the 1 is located in the 10th row (if rows are 0-based) and 2nd column (assuming columns are 0-based). Let's check:\n\nIn example 1's input, the 1 is at position (10, 2) (assuming rows 0-13). The output has 2s in some positions. Let's see if that's the distance. For example, the 8s in the input are replaced with 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are being replaced with numbers that represent how many steps away they are from the nearest 1. For example, if the 1 is at (10,2), then the 8s in the same row (row 10) would have varying distances. But in the output of example 1, the 2s are spread out. But maybe the output numbers are the Manhattan distance from the nearest 1. Let's see:\n\nTake the input of example 1. The 1 is in row 10 (if the input rows are 0-13?), let's check:\n\nLooking at the input for example 1:\n\nRow 10 (assuming 0-based) is \"0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\n\nSo the 1 is at (10, 2). Then, for example, in row 1, the 8s are in columns 7-8, 10-11. Let's compute the distance from (10,2) to (1,7). The Manhattan distance would be (10-1) + (7-2) = 9 +5=14. But the output in that area has 2s. That doesn't fit. So that idea is wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's think again. Maybe the 8s are being replaced with numbers that correspond to the number of 8s in their connected region. Or maybe the 8s form a structure that is being transformed into a specific number. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, in all examples, the numbers in the output are 0, 2, 3, 7, etc. The numbers seem to be the count of how many 8s are connected to the 1. Wait, but in example 1, the output has 2s. Maybe the 8s are being replaced with the number of 8s in their connected component. For example, if the 8s form a certain shape, and the output is the count of 8s in that component. But that seems unlikely. For example, in example 1, the output has 2s. But if the original 8s are in a big structure, then the number would be larger. So that's probably not the case.\n\nAnother thought: the output numbers could be the number of adjacent 8s. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the examples, each output has a number that's replacing the 8s and the 1s. For example, in example 1, the 1 is replaced with 0, and the 8s are replaced with 2s. In example 2, the 1s are replaced with 0s, and the 8s with 3s. In example 3, the 1s are replaced with 0s and 8s with 2s. In example 4, 8s are replaced with 7s. In example 5, 8s are replaced with 3s, and 1s with 0s. So the pattern seems to be that the 1s in the input are replaced with 0s, and the 8s are replaced with a certain number (depending on the example). But why?\n\nWait, but in example 1, the output's 2s are not in the same positions as the 1s. So perhaps the output numbers are the count of how many 8s are in the same connected region as the 1? Or maybe the number of 8s in the original input. But in example 1, there are a lot of 8s, so the output number would be higher than 2. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the output numbers are the number of 8s in the original input. But that's not possible, as example 1's output has 2s, and example 2's output has 3s, etc. So that suggests that each example has a different number. So maybe the number in the output is the count of 8s in the original input, but that seems arbitrary. For example, in example 1, how many 8s are there?\n\nLooking at example 1's input:\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 8 8 0 0 \u2192 that's 5 8s (positions 7,8,10,11, but wait let's count: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 8 8 0 0 \u2192 8 at 7,8,10,11 \u2192 that's four 8s? Or maybe I'm counting wrong. Let me recount:\n\nRow 1 (second line in input) is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 8 8 0 0 \u2192 that's 8s at positions 7, 8, 10, 11 \u2192 four 8s.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 \u2192 three 8s.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 four 8s.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 8 0 0 8 8 0 0 \u2192 four 8s.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 \u2192 four 8s.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 \u2192 two 8s.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 0 \u2192 six 8s.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 \u2192 two 8s.\n\nRow 9: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 one 1.\n\nSo total 8s in example 1's input is 4 +3 +4 +4 +4 +2 +6 +2 = let's add:\n\nRow 1: 4\n\nRow 2: 3 \u2192 total 7\n\nRow3: 4 \u2192 11\n\nRow4: 4 \u2192 15\n\nRow5:4 \u2192 19\n\nRow6:2 \u2192 21\n\nRow7:6 \u219227\n\nRow8:2 \u219229.\n\nSo 29 8s. But the output has 2s. So that can't be the case.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is the number of 8s adjacent to the 1. But the 1 is in row 9 (assuming rows start at 0), column 2. Let me check the input. The 1 is in row 9 (assuming the first line is row 0?), but looking at the input for example 1:\n\nThe input is given as 14 rows. Let me count the rows:\n\nThe first line is 0 0 0 ... \u2192 row 0.\n\nThen row 1, row 2, etc. The 1 is in the 10th line (row 9?), assuming rows are 0-based.\n\nIn row 9, the 1 is at column 2. Let's check the surrounding cells. The cells adjacent to (9,2) are (8,2), (10,2), (9,1), (9,3), (8,1), (8,3), (10,1), (10,3). But looking at the input, the row 9 is \"0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" \u2192 so (9,2) is 1. The cells around it: row 8 (which is the line before row 9), which is \"0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\" \u2192 so (8,2) is 0. So no 8s adjacent. So that's not it.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the numbers in the output are the count of the number of 8s that are connected to the 1. But the 1 is in a separate area, maybe not connected to the 8s. So that's not possible.\n\nLooking at the outputs again, perhaps the 8s are being replaced with the number of 1s in the input. But in example 1, there is one 1, but the output has 2s. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers are based on the position of the 1. Like, for example, in example 1, the 1 is in the 10th row (row index 9), and the output has 2s. But how does that relate? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output numbers are determined by the number of 1s and their positions. But in the examples, there's only one 1 each.\n\nWait, looking at the examples, the output numbers for the 8s are varying. For example, example 1 has 2s, example 2 has 3s, example 3 has 2s, example 4 has 7s, example 5 has 3s. So what's the pattern here? Maybe the number is the number of 1s in the input. But all examples have only one 1. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, the number is the count of how many 8s are in the original input. But in example 1, there are 29 8s, but output is 2. No.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the output numbers are the count of how many times the 8s appear in the original input. But again, no.\n\nWait, perhaps the output numbers are the count of how many times the 8s are in a certain pattern. Like, for example, the 8s form a certain shape, and the output number is the number of such shapes. But I don't see that.\n\nAlternatively, think about the outputs. In example 1, the output has 2s, which may represent the number of 1s in the input. But there's only one. So not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs, in example 1, the output has 2s where the 8s were, and the 1 in the input is replaced with 0. In example 2, the output has 3s where the 8s were, and the 1s are replaced with 0. In example 3, 2s. In example 4, 7s. In example 5, 3s. So the output number seems to be varying. What's the pattern?\n\nMaybe the output number is the count of 1s in the input. But all examples have one 1. So that's not. Or the count of 8s in the input. But example 1 has 29 8s and output is 2. No.\n\nWait, looking at example 1's output. The output has 2s in the positions where the 8s were. Maybe the 2 is the number of 1s in the input. But no, there's only one. Or maybe the number is the number of 8s that are adjacent to the 1. But the 1 is isolated from the 8s.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output numbers are the number of 8s in the original input that are connected to the 1. But if the 1 is not connected to any 8s, then it would be zero. But in the examples, the output numbers are 2, 3, etc. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are being replaced with the number of times they are part of a certain structure. For example, in example 1, the 8s form a sort of 'U' shape. But how does that translate to 2?\n\nAlternatively, looking for a pattern between the output numbers and the input's 1 positions. For example, in example 1, the 1 is in row 9, column 2. The output has 2s. In example 2, the 1s are in rows 10 and 11. The output has 3s. In example 3, the 1s are in rows 10 and 11. Output is 2s. In example 4, the 1 is in row 10, column 6. Output has 7s. In example 5, the 1 is in row 9, column 2. Output has 3s. So there's no clear relation between the position of 1 and the output number.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is the number of 8s that are in the same row or column as the 1. But in example 1, the 1 is in row 9 (assuming rows are 0-based), and the 8s are in other rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers are the number of 8s in the input's rows that have the 1. But the 1 is in row 9 (example 1), which has no 8s. So that's not.\n\nWait, maybe the output numbers are the number of 8s in the same column as the 1. For example, in example 1, the 1 is in column 2. Let's count how many 8s are in column 2 across all rows. Let me check:\n\nIn example 1's input:\n\nRow 0: column 2 is 0.\n\nRow 1: column 2 is 0.\n\nRow 2: column 2 is 0.\n\nRow 3: column 2 is 0.\n\nRow 4: column 2 is 0.\n\nRow 5: column 2 is 0.\n\nRow 6: column 2 is 0.\n\nRow 7: column 2 is 0.\n\nRow 8: column 2 is 0.\n\nRow 9: column 2 is 1.\n\nRow 10: column 2 is 0.\n\nRow 11: column 2 is 0.\n\nRow 12: column 2 is 0.\n\nRow 13: column 2 is 0.\n\nSo no 8s in column 2. So that doesn't explain the 2s in the output.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let me think of another approach.\n\nMaybe the output is a transformation where each 8 is replaced with a number that depends on the number of 1s in the input. But since there's only one 1 in each example, that doesn't explain the different numbers.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs again. In example 1, the output's 2s might correspond to the number of 1s in the input, but since there's one, it doesn't. Alternatively, the number is the count of 1s in the input plus 1. But example 1 would have 2, which matches. Example 2 has 2 1s (since in example 2's input, there are two 1s: in row 10 and 11). Wait, let me check example 2's input:\n\nIn example 2's input, the 1s are in row 10: \"0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" and row 11: \"0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So there are two 1s. The output has 3s. So 2+1=3, which matches. Example 3's input has 1s in row 10 and 11: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\" and \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0\" \u2192 two 1s. Output is 2s. But 2+1=3, which doesn't match. So this idea is invalid.\n\nBut example 3's output has 2s, which could be the count of 1s. So that would be 2. But why in example 2, the output is 3? So maybe it's the count of 1s plus 1? For example, in example 2, two 1s \u2192 2 +1=3. Example 3 has two 1s, but output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Let's think of the outputs:\n\nExample 1: 1 1 \u2192 output number 2.\n\nExample 2: 2 1s \u2192 output number 3.\n\nExample 3: 2 1s \u2192 output number 2.\n\nExample 4: 1 1 \u2192 output number 7.\n\nExample 5: 1 1 \u2192 output number 3.\n\nThis is inconsistent. So this approach is not working.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps the output number is the number of 8s in the input that are connected to the 1. But if the 1 is not connected to any 8s, then it would be 0. But in example 1, the output has 2s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output numbers are the count of 8s in the input. But as before, example 1 has 29 8s and output is 2.\n\nWait, maybe it's the number of 8s in the input divided by some number. For example, example 1: 29 \u2192 29 / 14 \u2248 2.07 \u2192 2. But that's just a guess. For example 2: how many 8s? Let me check.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\nLooking at the input:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: all 0s.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 \u2192 5 8s?\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 \u2192 4 8s.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 \u2192 5 8s.\n\nRow 5-13: all 0s except row 10-12: has 1s.\n\nSo total 8s in example 2: 5+4+5 = 14. So 14 8s. The output has 3s. 14 divided by something? Not sure.\n\nExample 3's input has 8s in rows 0-4, etc. Let me count:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 two 8s.\n\nRow 1: 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0 \u2192 five 8s.\n\nRow 2: 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 \u2192 ten 8s.\n\nRow 3: 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0 \u2192 five 8s.\n\nRow 4: 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 \u2192 three 8s.\n\nRow 5-13: all 0s except for the 1s. So total 2+5+10+5+3 = 25 8s. Output has 2s. 25 divided by something? Not sure.\n\nExample 4's input has 8s in various rows. Let me count:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 two 8s.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 \u2192 three 8s.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 \u2192 two 8s.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 0 \u2192 seven 8s.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 8 8 8 0 8 8 \u2192 six 8s.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 0 \u2192 three 8s.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 \u2192 four 8s.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 \u2192 three 8s.\n\nOther rows are 0s. Total: 2+3+2+7+6+3+4+3= 2+3=5+2=7+7=14+6=20+3=23+4=27+3=30. So 30 8s. Output has 7s. 30/4.28...? Not sure.\n\nExample 5's input: Let me count 8s.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 one 8.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 \u2192 five 8s.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 \u2192 three 8s.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 8 8 0 0 \u2192 three 8s.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 8 0 0 \u2192 three 8s.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 \u2192 one 8.\n\nOther rows: 0s. So total 1+5+3+3+3+1 = 16 8s. Output has 3s. 16/5.3...? Not sure.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's try another way.\n\nMaybe the output numbers are based on the positions of the 1s and the 8s. For instance, the 8s are replaced with the number of 1s in their row or column, but again, not sure.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the output numbers (for the 8s) are the same across the entire region where the 8s were. For example, in example 1, all 8s are replaced with 2s. In example 2, all 8s are replaced with 3s. So it's a uniform number for each example. So the number depends on the entire input, not on individual cells.\n\nSo what's different between the examples? Let's look at the positions of the 1s and the 8s.\n\nIn example 1, the 1 is in a separate area from the 8s. In example 2, the 1s are in a different area from the 8s. In example 3, the 1s are near the 8s. Wait, in example 3's input:\n\nThe input has 1s in rows 10-12. Let me look at the input for example 3:\n\nThe input for example 3 has:\n\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0\n\n0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\n\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0\n\n0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0\n\n... then rows with 1s:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\n... and so on.\n\nSo the 1s are in the lower part, while the 8s are in the upper part. So the 8s are not connected to the 1s.\n\nBut in example 3's output, the 8s are replaced with 2s. Why?\n\nMaybe the number is the number of 1s in the input. Example 3 has two 1s (rows 10 and 11?), but the output is 2. That fits. Example 1 has 1 1 \u2192 output 2? No, 1+1=2. Example 2 has two 1s \u2192 output 3 (2+1). Example 3 has two 1s \u2192 output 2. This doesn't fit.\n\nBut example 5 has one 1, and the output is 3. So 1 + 2 = 3. Not sure.\n\nThis seems inconsistent, but maybe there's a different pattern. For example, the output number is the number of 1s plus the number of 8s divided by some value. For example, in example 1: 1 + 29 = 30, divided by 15 gives 2. But this is too arbitrary.\n\nAnother idea: The number in the output is the number of 1s in the input plus the number of rows or columns. But this is also arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, the number is the number of 1s multiplied by the number of 8s. For example, example 1: 1 * 29 = 29 \u2192 no.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input provided, which is the one I need to solve. Let's see what it looks like.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 8\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 8\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 13: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo in this test input, there's a single 1 in row 8, columns 6-8 (row 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 columns 6,7,8 are 1s). Also, row 9 has 1 in column 6 and 8. Row 10 has 1 in column 7.\n\nSo the 1s are in a cluster. The 8s are in rows 1, 2, 3, 4. Let's see:\n\nRow 1 has 8s from column 5 to 13 (8 columns). Row 2 has 8s in columns 5, 9, 11, 13. Row 3 has 8s in columns 5, 7, 9, 13. Row 4 has 8s from column 5 to 13. So the 8s form a sort of vertical structure on the left side, with some holes.\n\nNow, the output for this test case needs to replace the 8s with a number and the 1s with 0s. Let's try to see what the pattern is.\n\nLooking at the examples, the output number for the 8s seems to be determined by the number of 1s in the input. For example, in example 1, there is 1 1, and the output is 2. In example 2, there are 2 1s and output is 3. In example 3, there are 2 1s and output is 2. In example 4, 1 1 and output is 7. In example 5, 1 1 and output is 3.\n\nThis seems inconsistent, but perhaps there's another pattern. Let me think about the positions of the 1s and 8s.\n\nIn example 1, the 1 is isolated from the 8s. In example 2, the 1s are isolated from the 8s. In example 3, the 1s are near the 8s. In example 4, the 1 is isolated. In example 5, the 1 is near the 8s.\n\nSo perhaps the output number is determined by the distance from the 1s to the 8s. For example, in example 1, the 1 is far away from the 8s, so the output number is 2. In example 3, the 1 is near the 8s, so the output is 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number is the number of 1s multiplied by some factor. But example 3 has 2 1s and output is 2, example 1 has 1 1 and output is 2 (1 * 2). Example 2 has 2 1s and output is 3 (2 + 1). Example 4 has 1 1 and output is 7 (1 * 7). Example 5 has 1 1 and output is 3 (1 * 3). This doesn't show a clear pattern.\n\nBut perhaps the number is the number of 1s plus the number of rows or columns. For example, example 1 has 1 1, and 14 rows. 1 + 13 = 14, but the output is 2. No.\n\nAnother observation: In the examples where the 1s are in the same region as the 8s, the output number is smaller. For example, example 3 has 1s near the 8s, and output is 2. Example 5 has 1s near the 8s, output is 3. Example 4 has 1s far from the 8s, output is 7. Example 1 has 1s far from the 8s, output is 2. So it's not consistent.\n\nMaybe the number is the number of 1s in the input. For example, in example 1, 1 \u2192 2. No, but in example 3, 2 \u2192 2. In example 2, 2 \u2192 3. So not.\n\nWait, maybe it's the number of 1s plus the number of 8s in the input. For example:\n\nExample 1: 1 + 29 = 30 \u2192 output 2. No.\n\nExample 2: 2 + 14 = 16 \u2192 output 3. No.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nMaybe the number is the number of 1s multiplied by the number of 8s divided by something. For example, example 1: 1 * 29 = 29, divided by 14.5 gives 2. But this is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, it's the number of 1s multiplied by the number of 8s in the input, but rounded down. For example, example 1: 1 * 29 = 29, but output is 2. No.\n\nThis is really frustrating. Maybe I should look at the test input and try to deduce the output based on the examples.\n\nThe test input has a cluster of 1s in the lower part and a block of 8s in the upper part. Let's see what the output might look like. The 1s would be replaced with 0s, and the 8s with some number.\n\nLooking at the examples, when the 1s are isolated from the 8s, like in example 1 and 2, the output number for 8s is 2, 3, etc. When the 1s are near the 8s, like in example 3 and 5, it's 2 or 3.\n\nMaybe the number is the number of 1s in the input. For example, in the test input, there are 3 1s (row 8 has 3, row 9 has 2, row 10 has 1. Wait, let's count:\n\nIn the test input, rows 8, 9, 10 have 1s.\n\nRow 8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\" \u2192 three 1s.\n\nRow 9: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\" \u2192 two 1s.\n\nRow 10: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\" \u2192 one 1.\n\nTotal 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 1s? Or are they separate? Let me check:\n\nRow 8 has three 1s (columns 6,7,8).\n\nRow 9 has 1 at column 6 and 8 (columns 6 and 8).\n\nRow 10 has 1 at column 7.\n\nSo total 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 1s.\n\nIf the output number for the 8s is 6, then the output would have 6s in the 8s' positions. But looking at the examples, like example 1 has 1 1 and output is 2, example 2 has 2 1s and output is 3, example 3 has 2 1s and output is 2, example 4 has 1 1 and output is 7, example 5 has 1 1 and output is 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the number is the number of 1s plus 1. For example, test input has 6 1s, so output would be 7. But example 4 has 1 1 and output is 7. So that could fit. Let's see:\n\nExample 1: 1 1 \u2192 1 + 1 = 2 \u2192 matches.\n\nExample 2: 2 1s \u2192 2 + 1 = 3 \u2192 matches.\n\nExample 3: 2 1s \u2192 2 + 0 = 2? No, but if it's 2 + 0, it's 2. But why?\n\nExample 4: 1 1 \u2192 1 + 6 = 7? Why 6? Not sure.\n\nExample 5: 1 1 \u2192 1 + 2 = 3 \u2192 matches.\n\nThis seems to fit some examples. For example, if the test input has 6 1s, the output number would be 6 + 1 = 7. But why would example 4's output be 7? Because it has 1 1, and 1 + 6 = 7? But why 6? Maybe the number is the number of 1s plus the number of rows or something else.\n\nBut this is still speculative. Let's check example 4: it has 1 1, and the output is 7. If the number is 1 + 6 = 7, where does the 6 come from? Maybe the number of 8s in the input? For example, example 4 has 30 8s, but 1 + 30 = 31. No.\n\nAlternatively, it's the number of 1s multiplied by some factor. For example, 1 * 7 = 7. But why 7?\n\nThis is getting too speculative. Maybe the pattern is that the 8s are replaced with the number of 1s in the input. But in example 1, it's 1, but output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: The output number is the number of 1s in the input plus the number of rows or columns where the 8s are. For example, in example 1, the 8s are in rows 1-4, so 4 rows. 1 + 4 = 5, but output is 2. No.\n\nMaybe the number is the number of 1s in the input multiplied by the number of 8s in the input. But for example 1: 1 * 29 = 29, but output is 2. No.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs, the numbers are 2, 3, 2, 7, 3. These numbers seem to be the count of how many 1s are in the input, but with some adjustment. For example, if the number of 1s is 1, the output is 2, 3, or 7. This suggests that it's not directly related.\n\nWait, let me look at the test input. If I can find a pattern based on the test input, maybe I can guess the output.\n\nThe test input has a block of 8s in rows 1-4, and 1s in the lower part. The 8s are in a vertical block with some gaps. The 1s are in a cluster.\n\nMaybe the output number is the number of 1s in the input. But in the test input, there are 6 1s. So the output would have 6s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number is the number of 1s in the input, but for example 1, it's 1, but output is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the output for the 8s is a number that is one more than the number of 1s in the input. Example 1: 1 + 1 = 2. Example 2: 2 + 1 = 3. Example 3: 2 + 0 = 2. Example 4: 1 + 6 = 7. Example 5: 1 + 2 = 3. This seems inconsistent, but if we assume that in some cases it's 1 + 1, and others it's 1 + 6, it's not clear.\n\nWait, in example 4, the output is 7. If the test input has 6 1s, then 6 + 1 = 7. This would fit. Let's check other examples:\n\nExample 1: 1 + 1 = 2 \u2192 fits.\n\nExample 2: 2 + 1 = 3 \u2192 fits.\n\nExample 3: 2 + 0 = 2 \u2192 but why 0? If the number of 1s is 2, and the number of 8s is 25, then 2 + 25 = 27, which doesn't make sense.\n\nExample 4: 1 + 6 = 7 \u2192 fits.\n\nExample 5: 1 + 2 = 3 \u2192 fits.\n\nThis suggests that for some examples, the output number is the number of 1s plus 1. For example 3, it's 2, which is 2 + 0. But why? Maybe it's the number of 1s plus the number of 8s in the input divided by some value.\n\nAlternatively, it's the number of 1s plus the number of 8s in the input divided by 10. For example, example 1: 1 + 29/10 = 4.9 \u2192 2? No.\n\nThis is too uncertain.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for another pattern. Let's look at the output for the test input. If the 8s are replaced with a number, and the 1s with 0s, what could it be?\n\nLooking at the test input, the 8s form a vertical block in the upper part, and the 1s are in the lower part. Maybe the number is the number of 1s in the input, but in this case, it's 6, so the output would have 6s. But I don't know. Alternatively, it's the number of 1s in the input plus the number of rows where 8s are. For example, rows 1-4 (4 rows), 6 + 4 = 10, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number is the number of 1s in the input, and for the test input, it would be 6, so output is 6. But how to confirm?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the examples, the output numbers are 2, 3, 2, 7, 3. These are all small numbers. Maybe the number is the number of 1s in the input, but if it's more than 3, it's 3 or something. But this is guesswork.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output number is the number of 1s in the input, and the 8s are replaced with that number. For example, in the test input, there are 6 1s, so the output would be 6. But I have no evidence for this.\n\nAlternatively, the number is the count of 1s in the input, and if it's more than 3, it's capped at 3. But example 4 has 1 1 and output is 7, which contradicts this.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for another pattern, like the number of 1s in the input plus the number of 8s in the input, but divided by some number.\n\nFor example, test input has 6 1s and 25 8s (from earlier calculation). 6 + 25 = 31. Divided by 10 gives 3.1 \u2192 3. But this is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, the number is the number of 1s in the input multiplied by 2. For example, 6 * 2 = 12, but no.\n\nAt this point, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's look at the test input's 8s and 1s.\n\nThe test input's 1s are in a cluster, and the 8s are in a block. If the 1s are near the 8s, the output number is smaller, like 2 or 3. If they are far, it's larger, like 7. In the test input, the 1s are in the lower part, and the 8s are in the upper part. So they are separated by several rows. This might mean the output number is higher, like 7, similar to example 4. But example 4 has 1 1 and output is 7. If the test input has 6 1s, maybe the number is 6 + 1 = 7, or 6 + 0 = 6.\n\nBut why would example 4 have 7? If it's the number of 1s plus the number of 8s in the input, for example 4, 1 + 30 = 31, which is not 7. No.\n\nAlternatively, the number is the number of 1s in the input. For example, test input has 6 1s, so the output is 6. But I have no basis for this.\n\nGiven the lack of clear pattern, and the fact that in example 4, the output is 7, which is the number of rows (14 rows?), but no, 14 is not 7. Or it's the number of 8s in the input, but example 4 has 30 8s and output is 7.\n\nAlternatively, the number is the number of 1s in the input plus the number of rows where 8s are. For example, in example 4, 1 1 + 4 rows (rows 0-3) = 5, but output is 7.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to look for the pattern in the test input based on the examples. For example, if the 8s are replaced with 2, 3, 2, 7, 3, and the test input's 1s are in a cluster, perhaps the number is 2 or 3. But how to decide?\n\nAlternatively, the number is the number of 1s in the input. For the test input, it's 6, so output is 6. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since in example 3, the 1s are near the 8s and the output is 2, and in example 5, the 1s are near the 8s and the output is 3, maybe the number is the number of 1s in the input. For the test input, it's 6, so the output is 6. But this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, since the 8s in the test input form a vertical block, and in example 3, the 8s form a similar block, and the output was 2, maybe the number is 2. But example 5 has a similar block and output is 3. So no.\n\nI'm forced to make a guess. Given that in example 4, the output is 7, which is the same as the number of 1s in the test input (if it's 7), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me count the number of 1s in the test input again:\n\nRow 8: 3 1s.\n\nRow 9: 2 1s.\n\nRow 10: 1 1.\n\nTotal 3 + 2 + 1 = 6. So 6 1s.\n\nIf the pattern is that the output number is the number of 1s in the input, then the test input would have 6. But I have no way to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, if the number is the number of 1s plus the number of 8s divided by 10, for example, 6 + 25/10 = 8.5 \u2192 8. But this is arbitrary.\n\nGiven that I have to choose, and in the examples, when the 1s are isolated from the 8s, the output number is 2, 3, 7. For example, in the test input, the 1s are isolated from the 8s, so the output number could be 2, 3, or 7. But which one?\n\nLooking at example 4, which has 1 1 and the 8s are isolated, the output is 7. So maybe the number is 7 for the test input. But why?\n\nIf the number is the number of rows where 8s are. In the test input, the 8s are in rows 1, 2, 3, 4 \u2192 4 rows. 4 + 3 = 7? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number is the number of 8s in the input. For the test input, 25 8s, but output is 25, but that's not in the examples.\n\nAt this point, I'll have to make a guess based on example 4, where the 1 is isolated and the output is 7. If the test input's 1s are also isolated from the 8s, maybe the output is 7. So the 8s in the test input would be replaced with 7s, and the 1s with 0s.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nAll rows with 0s, except where the 8s are, which are replaced with 7s, and the 1s replaced with 0s.\n\nSo the test input's output would be:\n\nFor rows 1-4, the 8s are replaced with 7s, and the 1s in rows 8-10 are replaced with 0s.\n\nThus, the final output would have 7s in the areas where the 8s were, and 0s where the 1s were.\n\nSo the boxed answer would be:\n\n[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7],\n [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,7],\n [0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,7],\n [0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n ... and so on for the rest, with 0s in the 1 areas.\n\nBut I'm not certain.

The input is a 2x2 grid, and I need to transform it into a 6x6 grid following the given instructions. Let me make sure I understand each step correctly.\n\nFirst, the input grid is:\n\n3 2\n7 8\n\nSo the original rows are [3, 2] and [7, 8]. \n\nStep 2 says to repeat each original row three times. For the first row [3,2], repeating three times would give [3,2,3,2,3,2]. Similarly, the second row [7,8] becomes [7,8,7,8,7,8]. So those are the first two rows of the output.\n\nThen step 3 is swapping the elements in each original row. So [3,2] becomes [2,3], and [7,8] becomes [8,7]. \n\nStep 4 says to repeat each swapped row three times. So [2,3] becomes [2,3,2,3,2,3], and [8,7] becomes [8,7,8,7,8,7]. These are the next two rows.\n\nStep 5 says to repeat the original rows again. So again, the original rows [3,2] and [7,8] repeated three times, giving the same as the first two rows. So adding those two rows again.\n\nPutting it all together, the order is:\n\nOriginal rows (each repeated three times) \u2192 two rows.\nSwapped rows (each repeated three times) \u2192 two rows.\nOriginal rows again \u2192 two rows.\n\nSo total of 6 rows. Let me check the example given in the instructions. The example had the original rows, then swapped, then original again. So the order is correct.\n\nSo for the input grid, the output should be:\n\nFirst two rows:\n[3,2,3,2,3,2]\n[7,8,7,8,7,8]\n\nThen the swapped rows:\n[2,3,2,3,2,3]\n[8,7,8,7,8,7]\n\nThen again the original rows:\n[3,2,3,2,3,2]\n[7,8,7,8,7,8]\n\nSo the final 6x6 grid is these six rows. Let me make sure I didn't mix up any steps. Let me recheck each step.\n\nOriginal rows: yes. Step 2: repeat each three times. Then step 3: swap elements. Step 4: repeat each swapped row three times. Then step 5: repeat original rows again. So the order is original, swapped, original. So the six rows are as above.\n\nNow, I need to represent this as a 2D array. Each row is a list of six elements. So the final answer should be:\n\n[\n [3,2,3,2,3,2],\n [7,8,7,8,7,8],\n [2,3,2,3,2,3],\n [8,7,8,7,8,7],\n [3,2,3,2,3,2],\n [7,8,7,8,7,8]\n]\n\nI need to make sure that each row is correctly formed. Let me check each row:\n\nFirst row: original [3,2] repeated three times. So 3,2, then 3,2, then 3,2. Yes. Same for the second row. Then swapped rows: [2,3] repeated three times. Third row is 2,3,2,3,2,3. Fourth row is 8,7,8,7,8,7. Then again the original rows. Yes.\n\nSo that's correct. Now, the problem says to present it as a 2D array inside \\boxed{} in the exact format. So I need to write it as [[row1], [row2], ...], with each row as a list. Let me make sure that the numbers are correct. The input is 3 2 and 7 8. So yes.\n\nI think that's it. Let me just confirm once again that I didn't swap the rows incorrectly. For the original rows, [3,2] becomes [2,3], and [7,8] becomes [8,7]. Correct. Then repeating those.
