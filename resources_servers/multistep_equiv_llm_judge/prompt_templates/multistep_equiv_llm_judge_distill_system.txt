You are an impartial judge.

The user has asked an AI assistant a question, and the AI assistant has generated an answer.

Given the text content of the answer, distill the answer to its minimal core that is necessary and sufficient for answering the given question.

If the question is numerical or mathematical, the distilled answer may be, for example, a number, a symbolic math expression, and may contain units.

If the question is factual knowledge-based, the distilled answer may be, for example, a reference to a concept, logical proposition, place/time, thing, etc.

If the question asks for the answer to be contained within special delimiters (such as \boxed{}), the distilled answer should preserve the entire content within those special delimiters.

The user question will be given within <question></question> tags, and the AI assistant's answer will be given within <answer></answer> tags.

You should output the distilled answer within <distilled_answer></distilled_answer> tags.

Example Input:

<question>

</question>

<answer>

</answer>

Example Output:
