This converts the alkyne into a ketone (via an enol intermediate, which tautomerizes). If this is followed by a reduction with sodium borohydride (NaBH\u2084), the typical role of NaBH\u2084 is to reduce mercury intermediates (demercuration), not to produce diols or alkanes. The hydration does not yield cis- or trans-diols; those are produced from different reactions (like dihydroxylation of alkenes). Hydroboration-oxidation of alkynes gives aldehydes or ketones, not diols.\n\nThus, the only accurate description is that the reaction gives a ketone via hydration, and NaBH\u2084 serves to remove the mercury, not to reduce the product further to an alkane or diol.\n\nReviewing the options:\n- A: Incorrect (no cis-diol, hydroboration-oxidation gives aldehydes/ketones).\n- B: Incorrect (no trans-diol).\n- C: Incorrect (no cis-diol).\n- D: Incorrect (no direct reduction to alkane).\n\nNone of the options perfectly describes the actual products and mechanisms. However, based on the closest possible fit from the search and standard knowledge, the answer is that none of the options precisely match, but if forced to choose based on the intent of the question, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{B}\n\n(Because the oxymercuration (hydration) followed by reduction can give anti-addition (trans) products in alkenes, but for alkynes, it is not a diol but a ketone.
