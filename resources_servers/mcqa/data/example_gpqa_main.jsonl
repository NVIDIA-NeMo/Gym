A large gene has dozens of exons, of which the central ones code for folded triple helical repeats that connect the cytoskeleton with sarcolemma and extracellular space. Each exon usually codes for one folded triple alpha helix. The most common mutations of the gene are central exon deletions that create out-of-frame peptides and progressive degenerative organ waste. A solution is to deliver a Morpholino that recognizes the 5' end of the out-of-frame exon in pre-mRNA. The molecule prevents binding of the spliceosome and creates exon skipping and in-frame joining.

A coating is applied to a substrate resulting in a perfectly smooth surface. The measured contact angles of this smooth coating are 132° and 102° for water and hexadecane respectively. The coating formulation is then modified and when now applied to the same type of substrate, a rough surface is produced. When a droplet of water or oil sits on the rough surface, the wettability of the surface can now be described by the Cassie-Baxter state. The water contact angle on the rough surface is now 148°.

We have θCB = 148°, θ1 = 132°, and θ2 is taken to be 180° (contact angle on air). We then have cos(148) = f1.cos(132) + f2.cos(180). By using f1 + f2 = 1, we can solve to give f1 = 0.46 and f2 = 0.54.\nNext we need to calculate the contact angle of hexadecane on the rough surface, we have θ1 = 102°, f1 = 0.46, f2 = 0.54, and θ2 is taken to be 180° (contact angle on air). Therefore, θCB = 129° for hexadecane. \nThe question however asks about a droplet of octane. Octane is a shorter oil molecule than hexadecane and has a lower surface tension than hexadecane. For a given surface, the contact angle of octane is therefore always lower than for hexadecane. Therefore, the answer is 124° as this is the only answer lower than the 129° of hexadecane.
