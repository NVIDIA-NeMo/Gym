The counter appears to be empty. You move on, clearly upset by TextWorld. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors?
