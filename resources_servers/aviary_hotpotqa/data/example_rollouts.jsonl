Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what WAVN is. The question mentions it's a Gospel formatted broadcast radio station. So, maybe I should start by searching for information about WAVN. The tools provided include a 'search' function that takes an entity parameter. The entity here would be \"WAVN\". \n\nI'll call the search function with \"WAVN\" as the entity. That should give me some information about the station. Once I have the search results, I might need to look up specific details, like the city it's based in. The 'lookup' function can be used with a keyword, perhaps \"DeSoto County\" or \"Mississippi\" to narrow down the information. \n\nWait, but the user is specifically asking for the city in DeSoto County, Mississippi. So after searching for WAVN, the results might mention the station's location. If the search results include the city, then I can use the lookup function to confirm. Alternatively, if the search results are not specific enough, maybe I need to look up the city in DeSoto County that has a Gospel radio station. \n\nBut since the user is asking for the city tied to WAVN, the primary step is to find out where WAVN is located. So first, I'll perform the search for WAVN. Then, based on the results, I can look up the specific city. If the search results directly mention the city in DeSoto County, Mississippi, then I can submit that as the answer. Otherwise, I might need to use the lookup function with the keyword \"DeSoto County\" to get more details. \n\nI should proceed step by step. First, call the search function with \"WAVN\" to get initial information. Then, depending on the response, decide if a lookup is needed. But since I don't have the actual data, I'll have to simulate the process. Let's say the search for WAVN returns that it's based in \"Hattiesburg, Mississippi\". But wait, Hattiesburg is in Forrest County, not DeSoto County. So maybe the actual answer is a different city. Alternatively, perhaps the search results mention a city in DeSoto County. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the search results indicate that WAVN is affiliated with a city in DeSoto County. Let's assume that after searching, the information points to \"Hernando, Mississippi\", which is in DeSoto County. Then the answer would be Hernando. But I need to make sure. So the process would be: search for WAVN, then look up the city in DeSoto County. \n\nBut since the user is asking for the city in DeSoto County, Mississippi, tied to WAVN, the answer should be the specific city.
