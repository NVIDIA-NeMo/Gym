The use of encryption had a contributing effect, and was originally thought to\nbe the main effect, but tests in a lab proved otherwise. This is thought to be tied to the initial backups, since most of the VMs in\nthis environment were deployed from the same few templates, so data change was\nactually fairly low, but because the initial backups included 96 jobs all at\nonce, it was impossible to contain SOs from spreading across containers while\nso many jobs were running at once. Reduce the occurrence of bad Segment\nLocality with the following initial backup procedures when setting up VMware\nwith Accelerator  backups to PDDE (Deduplication storage):\n\n  1. Review the VMs in the environment and determine what OS / Application are the majority of the VMs. Determine the top 5 to 10 *types* of VM. (If using templates, determine which is the most often deployed manually). This task is unfortunately time consuming if this data point is not already being tracked. It is not immediately available as a metric in VSphere. 2. Find one example VM from each of the types, determined in the previous step. 3. Create a simple VMware policy, with manual client selection and backup the first example ONLY--(ONE Virtual Machine in the policy). **It is critical to this solution that only one (1) job run to PDDE at any given moment until this procedure is complete. By running a single job, the data is filtered through PDPlugin and then sent to Deduplication Storage one SO at a time, sequentially filling up containers from a single backup, ensuring that the SO's for at least one image are all adjacent. Since this has a high degree of commonality with other VMs in the environment, this data will be referenced extensively, and we will benefit during reads since a large amount of the data will be adjacent and contiguous. 4. Repeat for each client; do not start a new backup until the previous is complete. The initial Deduplication rates will increase on subsequent jobs and is not the goal at this point. The current goal is to \"seed\" the PDDE storage with single contiguous data streams. 5. When the last VM determined from step 2 above has completed its backup, this procedure is complete, and backups can be started according to either VMware Intelligent Policy, or multiple manually selected clients without issue with the Accelerator feature enabled with as many jobs and clients at once that is appropriate for the PDDE storage unit in the environment. \n\ntitle: HotAdd transport mode requirements for VMware VM backups\nurl: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.100046069.html\n#### HotAdd transport mode requirements for VMware VM backups\n\nIt is suggested to consider the below options before using HotAdd transport\nmode to backup and restore VMs. * The backup host VM must be created from the scratch (Not from any template or cannot be a clone of any VM). * The backup host VM must reside under the same data center where the VM to backup exist. * The backup host VM must have enough number of SCSI controllers to accommodate VMDKs from other VMs to be mounted. * Maximum 4 SCSI controllers can be attached to one backup host VM. A single SCSI controller can have a maximum of 15 disks attached. * HotAdd works only with virtual machines with SCSI disks and is not supported for backing up virtual machines with IDE disks. * To run multiple concurrent jobs totally for more than 15 disks, it is necessary to add more SCSI controllers to the HotAdd host. The maximum number of 4 SCSI controllers can be added to a HotAdd host, so a total of 60 devices are supported at the maximum. * HotAdd requires the VMware Backup Host to have access to datastores where the Virtual Machine being backed up resides. This essentially means: ESX where the VMware backup host is running should have access to datastores where the Virtual Machine being backed up resides. * HotAdd cannot be used if the VMFS block size of the datastore containing the virtual machine folder for the target virtual machine does not match the VMFS block size of the datastore containing the VMware Backup Host virtual machine. * For example, if you back up virtual disk on a datastore with 1MB blocks, the VMware Backup Host must also be on a datastore with 1MB blocks. * Restores using HotAdd on a Windows Server 2008 and above proxy require setting the SAN policy to OnlineAll. * If we are converting a physical machine to a virtual machine with the intention of using HotAdd to back up the virtual machine, do not use IDE controllers for any disks that are used during the conversion process. * The VMware backup host will need the ability to connect to TCP port 443 on the vCenter and TCP ports 443 and 902 on ESX/ESXi hosts while using HotAdd for backup/restores.\n\ntitle: NetBackup for VMware best practices\nurl: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/doc/166027891-166028774-0/v19546127-166028774\ncollection_title: NetBackup&#x2122; for VMware Administrator's Guide\nproduct_version: ['10.5']\n## NetBackup for VMware best practices\n\nThe following are best practices for NetBackup for VMware:\n\n  * For a more efficient backup, the NetBackup media server and the VMware backup host should be installed on the same host. * When creating virtual machines, use the same name for both host name and display name.

When the last VM determined from step 2 above has completed its backup, this procedure is complete, and backups can be started according to either VMware Intelligent Policy, or multiple manually selected clients without issue with the Accelerator feature enabled with as many jobs and clients at once that is appropriate for the PDDE storage unit in the environment. \n\ntitle: HotAdd transport mode requirements for VMware VM backups\nurl: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.100046069.html\n#### HotAdd transport mode requirements for VMware VM backups\n\nIt is suggested to consider the below options before using HotAdd transport\nmode to backup and restore VMs. * The backup host VM must be created from the scratch (Not from any template or cannot be a clone of any VM). * The backup host VM must reside under the same data center where the VM to backup exist. * The backup host VM must have enough number of SCSI controllers to accommodate VMDKs from other VMs to be mounted. * Maximum 4 SCSI controllers can be attached to one backup host VM. A single SCSI controller can have a maximum of 15 disks attached. * HotAdd works only with virtual machines with SCSI disks and is not supported for backing up virtual machines with IDE disks. * To run multiple concurrent jobs totally for more than 15 disks, it is necessary to add more SCSI controllers to the HotAdd host. The maximum number of 4 SCSI controllers can be added to a HotAdd host, so a total of 60 devices are supported at the maximum. * HotAdd requires the VMware Backup Host to have access to datastores where the Virtual Machine being backed up resides. This essentially means: ESX where the VMware backup host is running should have access to datastores where the Virtual Machine being backed up resides. * HotAdd cannot be used if the VMFS block size of the datastore containing the virtual machine folder for the target virtual machine does not match the VMFS block size of the datastore containing the VMware Backup Host virtual machine. * For example, if you back up virtual disk on a datastore with 1MB blocks, the VMware Backup Host must also be on a datastore with 1MB blocks. * Restores using HotAdd on a Windows Server 2008 and above proxy require setting the SAN policy to OnlineAll. * If we are converting a physical machine to a virtual machine with the intention of using HotAdd to back up the virtual machine, do not use IDE controllers for any disks that are used during the conversion process. * The VMware backup host will need the ability to connect to TCP port 443 on the vCenter and TCP ports 443 and 902 on ESX/ESXi hosts while using HotAdd for backup/restores.\n\ntitle: NetBackup for VMware best practices\nurl: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/doc/166027891-166028774-0/v19546127-166028774\ncollection_title: NetBackup&#x2122; for VMware Administrator's Guide\nproduct_version: ['10.5']\n## NetBackup for VMware best practices\n\nThe following are best practices for NetBackup for VMware:\n\n  * For a more efficient backup, the NetBackup media server and the VMware backup host should be installed on the same host. * When creating virtual machines, use the same name for both host name and display name. If the policy's Primary VM identifier option is changed, the existing entries on the policy Clients tab still work. * VMware recommends that you run no more than four simultaneous backups of virtual machines that reside on the same datastore. * Successful VMware snapshots depend on the following:\n\n    * The amount of I/O that occurs on the virtual machine datastore. Backups should be scheduled when relatively little I/O activity is expected. Reducing the number of simultaneous backups can also help. Limit access to the datastore per policy: Use the Limit jobs per policy\nattribute in the NetBackup policy. Limit access to the datastore globally (across all policies): Use the Host\nProperties Resource Limit screen. See [Change resource limits for VMware resource types](v137475382 \"Change\nresource limits for VMware resource types\"). * The design of the I/O substructure that is associated with each virtual machine datastore.\n\ntitle: VMware with Accelerator backups experiencing performance issues\nurl: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.100032433.html\nAccelerator optimization is not impacted, however the jobs take\nmore time to complete overall. **BPBKAR log** from the Linux VMware backup\nhost (a Windows VMware backup host does not capture these messages in the\nBPBKAR log):\n\n  `<4> vxms_shutdown: VxMS Performance stats: (../vxms_bridge.cpp:971)...<4>\nvxms_shutdown: **FIML ReadOnly Time: 71910514280** , Size: 6057328640, Ops:\n70645, **MB/s: 80.332** (../vxms_bridge.cpp:992)<4> vxms_shutdown: **ACCL\nChecksum Time: 169154432** , Size: 15761408, Ops: 130, **MB/s: 88.8611**\n(../vxms_bridge.cpp:994)<4> vxms_shutdown: **FIML Total Read Time:\n72079668712** , Size: 6073090048, Ops: 70775, **MB/s:\n80.3521**(../vxms_bridge.cpp:998)<4> vxms_shutdown: **FIML Write Time:\n26070366911696** , Size: 6057328640, Ops: 70645, **MB/s: 0.221582**\n(../vxms_bridge.cpp:1004)`\n\nNote here that the read time is not the problem, but **BPBKAR** appears to be\nwaiting on **BPTM** , indicating a delay committing write operations.

If the policy's Primary VM identifier option is changed, the existing entries on the policy Clients tab still work. * VMware recommends that you run no more than four simultaneous backups of virtual machines that reside on the same datastore. * Successful VMware snapshots depend on the following:\n\n    * The amount of I/O that occurs on the virtual machine datastore. Backups should be scheduled when relatively little I/O activity is expected. Reducing the number of simultaneous backups can also help. Limit access to the datastore per policy: Use the Limit jobs per policy\nattribute in the NetBackup policy. Limit access to the datastore globally (across all policies): Use the Host\nProperties Resource Limit screen. See [Setting global limits on the use of VMware resources](v47183490 \"Setting\nglobal limits on the use of VMware resources\"). * The design of the I/O substructure that is associated with each virtual machine datastore. For correct I/O design and implementation, consult your VMware documentation. * Make sure that the VMware backup host has enough memory to handle the number of simultaneous backups that occur. * Include in a single NetBackup policy those virtual machines that use the same datastore. This practice lets you control the amount of backup-related I/O that occurs per datastore, to limit the backup effect on the target virtual machines. * NetBackup supports multiple backup hosts. When a single backup host is saturated with a backup process, another backup host can be added to increase backup throughput. * If a VM's disks are accessible to multiple ESX hosts, the disks can be accessed for backup or restore through any of the ESX hosts. The ESX host may or may not be the ESX host where the virtual machine is running or registered. All of the following must be accessible to each other and should have DNS configured:\n\n    * The vCenter server. * All ESX hosts under the vCenter that have access to the VM's vmdk files.\n\ntitle: VMware with Accelerator backups experiencing performance issues\nurl: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.100032433.html\nThe Accelerator option is synthesizing a Full VMware backup when\nan Incremental is executed, and multiple reads of previous backups are slow\nbecause they have to read from many different containers. The use of encryption had a contributing effect, and was originally thought to\nbe the main effect, but tests in a lab proved otherwise. This is thought to be tied to the initial backups, since most of the VMs in\nthis environment were deployed from the same few templates, so data change was\nactually fairly low, but because the initial backups included 96 jobs all at\nonce, it was impossible to contain SOs from spreading across containers while\nso many jobs were running at once. Reduce the occurrence of bad Segment\nLocality with the following initial backup procedures when setting up VMware\nwith Accelerator  backups to PDDE (Deduplication storage):\n\n  1. Review the VMs in the environment and determine what OS / Application are the majority of the VMs. Determine the top 5 to 10 *types* of VM. (If using templates, determine which is the most often deployed manually). This task is unfortunately time consuming if this data point is not already being tracked. It is not immediately available as a metric in VSphere. 2. Find one example VM from each of the types, determined in the previous step. 3. Create a simple VMware policy, with manual client selection and backup the first example ONLY--(ONE Virtual Machine in the policy). **It is critical to this solution that only one (1) job run to PDDE at any given moment until this procedure is complete. By running a single job, the data is filtered through PDPlugin and then sent to Deduplication Storage one SO at a time, sequentially filling up containers from a single backup, ensuring that the SO's for at least one image are all adjacent. Since this has a high degree of commonality with other VMs in the environment, this data will be referenced extensively, and we will benefit during reads since a large amount of the data will be adjacent and contiguous. 4. Repeat for each client; do not start a new backup until the previous is complete. The initial Deduplication rates will increase on subsequent jobs and is not the goal at this point. The current goal is to \"seed\" the PDDE storage with single contiguous data streams. 5. When the last VM determined from step 2 above has completed its backup, this procedure is complete, and backups can be started according to either VMware Intelligent Policy, or multiple manually selected clients without issue with the Accelerator feature enabled with as many jobs and clients at once that is appropriate for the PDDE storage unit in the environment. \n\ntitle: HotAdd transport mode requirements for VMware VM backups\nurl: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.100046069.html\n#### HotAdd transport mode requirements for VMware VM backups\n\nIt is suggested to consider the below options before using HotAdd transport\nmode to backup and restore VMs. * The backup host VM must be created from the scratch (Not from any template or cannot be a clone of any VM). * The backup host VM must reside under the same data center where the VM to backup exist. * The backup host VM must have enough number of SCSI controllers to accommodate VMDKs from other VMs to be mounted. * Maximum 4 SCSI controllers can be attached to one backup host VM. A single SCSI controller can have a maximum of 15 disks attached. * HotAdd works only with virtual machines with SCSI disks and is not supported for backing up virtual machines with IDE disks. * To run multiple concurrent jobs totally for more than 15 disks, it is necessary to add more SCSI controllers to the HotAdd host. The maximum number of 4 SCSI controllers can be added to a HotAdd host, so a total of 60 devices are supported at the maximum. * HotAdd requires the VMware Backup Host to have access to datastores where the Virtual Machine being backed up resides. This essentially means: ESX where the VMware backup host is running should have access to datastores where the Virtual Machine being backed up resides. * HotAdd cannot be used if the VMFS block size of the datastore containing the virtual machine folder for the target virtual machine does not match the VMFS block size of the datastore containing the VMware Backup Host virtual machine. * For example, if you back up virtual disk on a datastore with 1MB blocks, the VMware Backup Host must also be on a datastore with 1MB blocks. * Restores using HotAdd on a Windows Server 2008 and above proxy require setting the SAN policy to OnlineAll. * If we are converting a physical machine to a virtual machine with the intention of using HotAdd to back up the virtual machine, do not use IDE controllers for any disks that are used during the conversion process. * The VMware backup host will need the ability to connect to TCP port 443 on the vCenter and TCP ports 443 and 902 on ESX/ESXi hosts while using HotAdd for backup/restores.\n\ntitle: NetBackup for VMware best practices\nurl: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/doc/166027891-166028774-0/v19546127-166028774\ncollection_title: NetBackup&#x2122; for VMware Administrator's Guide\nproduct_version: ['10.5']\n## NetBackup for VMware best practices\n\nThe following are best practices for NetBackup for VMware:\n\n  * For a more efficient backup, the NetBackup media server and the VMware backup host should be installed on the same host. * When creating virtual machines, use the same name for both host name and display name.

The use of encryption had a contributing effect, and was originally thought to\nbe the main effect, but tests in a lab proved otherwise. This is thought to be tied to the initial backups, since most of the VMs in\nthis environment were deployed from the same few templates, so data change was\nactually fairly low, but because the initial backups included 96 jobs all at\nonce, it was impossible to contain SOs from spreading across containers while\nso many jobs were running at once. Reduce the occurrence of bad Segment\nLocality with the following initial backup procedures when setting up VMware\nwith Accelerator  backups to PDDE (Deduplication storage):\n\n  1. Review the VMs in the environment and determine what OS / Application are the majority of the VMs. Determine the top 5 to 10 *types* of VM. (If using templates, determine which is the most often deployed manually). This task is unfortunately time consuming if this data point is not already being tracked. It is not immediately available as a metric in VSphere. 2. Find one example VM from each of the types, determined in the previous step. 3. Create a simple VMware policy, with manual client selection and backup the first example ONLY--(ONE Virtual Machine in the policy). **It is critical to this solution that only one (1) job run to PDDE at any given moment until this procedure is complete. By running a single job, the data is filtered through PDPlugin and then sent to Deduplication Storage one SO at a time, sequentially filling up containers from a single backup, ensuring that the SO's for at least one image are all adjacent. Since this has a high degree of commonality with other VMs in the environment, this data will be referenced extensively, and we will benefit during reads since a large amount of the data will be adjacent and contiguous. 4. Repeat for each client; do not start a new backup until the previous is complete. The initial Deduplication rates will increase on subsequent jobs and is not the goal at this point. The current goal is to \"seed\" the PDDE storage with single contiguous data streams. 5. When the last VM determined from step 2 above has completed its backup, this procedure is complete, and backups can be started according to either VMware Intelligent Policy, or multiple manually selected clients without issue with the Accelerator feature enabled with as many jobs and clients at once that is appropriate for the PDDE storage unit in the environment. \n\ntitle: HotAdd transport mode requirements for VMware VM backups\nurl: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.100046069.html\n#### HotAdd transport mode requirements for VMware VM backups\n\nIt is suggested to consider the below options before using HotAdd transport\nmode to backup and restore VMs. * The backup host VM must be created from the scratch (Not from any template or cannot be a clone of any VM). * The backup host VM must reside under the same data center where the VM to backup exist. * The backup host VM must have enough number of SCSI controllers to accommodate VMDKs from other VMs to be mounted. * Maximum 4 SCSI controllers can be attached to one backup host VM. A single SCSI controller can have a maximum of 15 disks attached. * HotAdd works only with virtual machines with SCSI disks and is not supported for backing up virtual machines with IDE disks. * To run multiple concurrent jobs totally for more than 15 disks, it is necessary to add more SCSI controllers to the HotAdd host. The maximum number of 4 SCSI controllers can be added to a HotAdd host, so a total of 60 devices are supported at the maximum. * HotAdd requires the VMware Backup Host to have access to datastores where the Virtual Machine being backed up resides. This essentially means: ESX where the VMware backup host is running should have access to datastores where the Virtual Machine being backed up resides. * HotAdd cannot be used if the VMFS block size of the datastore containing the virtual machine folder for the target virtual machine does not match the VMFS block size of the datastore containing the VMware Backup Host virtual machine. * For example, if you back up virtual disk on a datastore with 1MB blocks, the VMware Backup Host must also be on a datastore with 1MB blocks. * Restores using HotAdd on a Windows Server 2008 and above proxy require setting the SAN policy to OnlineAll. * If we are converting a physical machine to a virtual machine with the intention of using HotAdd to back up the virtual machine, do not use IDE controllers for any disks that are used during the conversion process. * The VMware backup host will need the ability to connect to TCP port 443 on the vCenter and TCP ports 443 and 902 on ESX/ESXi hosts while using HotAdd for backup/restores.\n\ntitle: NetBackup for VMware best practices\nurl: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/doc/166027891-166028774-0/v19546127-166028774\ncollection_title: NetBackup&#x2122; for VMware Administrator's Guide\nproduct_version: ['10.5']\n## NetBackup for VMware best practices\n\nThe following are best practices for NetBackup for VMware:\n\n  * For a more efficient backup, the NetBackup media server and the VMware backup host should be installed on the same host. * When creating virtual machines, use the same name for both host name and display name.
