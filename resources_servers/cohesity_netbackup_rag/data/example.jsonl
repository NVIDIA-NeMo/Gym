It takes advantage of VMware vSphere\nStorage APIs - Data Protection (formerly known as VMware vStorage APIs for\nData Protection or VADP). NetBackup primarily protects Virtual Machines,\nbackup is configured using 'VMware' as policy type. Backup operation comprises of different steps that depend on how virtual\nmachines are selected for backup. If VMs are explicitly selected, then one\nsnapshot and one backup job is used per VM to perform the backup. On the other\nhand, in the case of VMware Intelligent Policy (VIP), first, a discovery job\nis executed which identifies all the virtual machines matching the criteria\nset in the policy query, and then one snapshot and one backup job is executed\nper selected VM. There is only one discovery job for a policy. VIP policies\nare the recommended way to protect VMware VMs, as they allow use of resource\nlimits to control and limit the load of backup operations on VMware\ninfrastructure. Protection plans are aligned to VIP policies. Key Components of a NetBackup for VMware setup\n\n  * Backup host\n\nA NetBackup client that performs backups on behalf of the virtual machines. The backup host is the only host on which NetBackup client software is\ninstalled. No NetBackup client software is required on the VMware virtual\nmachines. Note that the backup host is referred to as the recovery host when\nit performs a restore. A NetBackup media server or primary server can also\nserve as a backup host. * Discovery host\n\nUsed for the automatic selection of virtual machines for backup via VMware\nIntelligent Policy (VIP). The discovery host can be on any platform that\nNetBackup supports for primary or media servers. It can also be the same host\nas the backup host. A discovery host is configured per policy and defaults to\n\"Backup media server\". * NetBackup media server\n\nPerforms the backups to storage on behalf of the NetBackup client. * NetBackup primary server\n\nManages the backups of virtual machines. General best practices and notes\n\n  * Virtual Machine setup\n\nWhen creating virtual machines, use the same name for both hostname and\ndisplay name. If the policy's Primary VM identifier option is changed, the\nexisting entries on the policy Clients tab still work. * Simultaneous backups\n\nVMware recommends that you run no more than four simultaneous backups of\nvirtual machines that reside on the same datastore. * Backup Host Memory\n\nMake sure that the VMware backup host has enough memory to handle the number\nof simultaneous backups that occur. * VMware backups and MSDP deduplication\n\nVMware backup to a deduplication storage unit, select the Enable file recovery\nfrom VM backup option on the VMware policy tab. This option provides the best\ndeduplication rates.\n\ntitle: NetBackup Replication Director for VMware: Best Practices and Troubleshooting\nurl: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.100023985.html\nThis article talks about some prerequisite & troubleshooting guidelines on\ncommon configuration pitfalls that one might encounter while working on\nReplication Director Features for protecting VMware VMs (virtual machines). ## **Pre-configuration:**\n\n  * NetApp volume/Qtree settings \n    * **Support Unicode format for directories** should be enabled  \n**Create/Convert Unicode** should be enabled:  \n[![](https://veritastech.custhelp.com/euf/assets/images/legacy/img/00Dj0000000JON4EAO/015j0000000soXyAAI.png)](https://veritastech.custhelp.com/euf/assets/images/legacy/img/00Dj0000000JON4EAO/015j0000000soXyAAI.png)  \n_click on this image to enlarge_\n\n  * Mappings between UNIX and Windows NT accounts and users \n    * Required if using Windows VMware Backup Host\n    * Setup uses **usermap.cfg** on NetApp filer  \n`NetApp uses the /etc/usermap.cfg file to map user names.

NetBackup primarily protects Virtual Machines,\nbackup is configured using 'VMware' as policy type. Backup operation comprises of different steps that depend on how virtual\nmachines are selected for backup. If VMs are explicitly selected, then one\nsnapshot and one backup job is used per VM to perform the backup. On the other\nhand, in the case of VMware Intelligent Policy (VIP), first, a discovery job\nis executed which identifies all the virtual machines matching the criteria\nset in the policy query, and then one snapshot and one backup job is executed\nper selected VM.

See [Overview of VMware tasks](v19545488 \"Overview of VMware tasks\"). * The NetBackup Java Runtime Environment (JRE) must be installed on the discovery host and the recovery host. Install the NetBackup Remote Administration Console to install NetBackup Java. * The VMware backup host must run on Windows or Linux.

See [NetBackup for VMware: notes on Linux virtual machines](v44010477\n\"NetBackup for VMware: notes on Linux virtual machines\"). * VMware virtual machine templates are for cloning virtual machines: They cannot be turned on and used as functioning VMs. As a result, VMware has imposed the following restrictions on backup and restore of virtual machine templates: \n\n    * A virtual machine template cannot be captured in a snapshot. NetBackup backs up the template to the designated storage unit. * Block level incremental backup (BLIB) cannot be used when backing up a virtual machine template. As a result of this restriction, NetBackup Accelerator cannot be used to back up VMware virtual machine templates. * A virtual machine template cannot be backed up over a SAN. You must configure the NetBackup policy to use a local network transfer type, such as nbd. Likewise, the restore of a template must be conducted over a local network. You can use the Query Builder in the NetBackup policy to create rules for automatic selection of virtual machine templates. * NetBackup supports non-ASCII characters in virtual machine objects. Examples of objects are file and folder names, annotations, floppy image name, parallel port or serial port file name, CD-ROM ISO name, and so on. Support for these characters is as follows:\n\n    * The backup host and the restore host may be the same computer. * Windows operating systems on the NetBackup primary server, the backup host, and the restore host do not assume non-ASCII characters in VM display name if the system locales of Windows hosts are not set to UTF-8. Even if the system locale is not set to UTF-8, a backup of the VMware virtual machine whose display name contains any non-ASCII characters may work. However, a restore from the VMware virtual machine backup that has non-ASCII characters in its display name needs a Linux or UNIX restore host which uses UTF-8 character encoding. * The UNIX and Linux operating systems on the NetBackup primary server, the backup host, and the restore host must use UTF-8 character encoding. * The name that NetBackup uses to select a VM for backups cannot contain non-ASCII characters. The Primary VM identifier field in the backup policy identifies the name type that NetBackup uses to select VMs. For example, if you specify the VM display name as the Primary VM identifier, the display name of each VM that you back up cannot contain non-ASCII characters. See [Primary VM identifier options (VMware)](v62458903 \"Primary VM identifier\noptions \\(VMware\\)\"). VM BIOS UUID and VM instance UUID names never contain non-ASCII characters. * For security purposes, VM names have some restrictions. See [NetBackup character restrictions for the Primary VM identifier](v50329751\n\"NetBackup character restrictions for the Primary VM identifier\"). * For dual-boot virtual machines, NetBackup does not support the following policy options: Enable file recovery from VM backup, Exclude deleted blocks, Exclude swap and paging files, Exclude boot disk,  Exclude all data disks. * NetBackup does not support the following exclude disks options for Replication Director backups: Exclude boot disk,  Exclude all data disks, Perform custom attribute based exclusion, Specific disks to be excluded. * To back up a virtual machine while Storage vMotion migrates its files, NetBackup must conduct the backup through the vCenter server. See [Conflict between NetBackup and VMware Storage vMotion with vSphere 5.0 or\nlater](v75833590 \"Conflict between NetBackup and VMware Storage vMotion with\nvSphere 5.0 or later\"). * Several notes and limitations apply to the automatic selection of virtual machines for backup (Virtual Machine Intelligent Policy).\n\ntitle: NetBackup for VMware best practices\nurl: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/doc/21902280-161976672-0/v19546127-161976672\ncollection_title: NetBackup&#x2122; for VMware Administrator's Guide\nproduct_version: ['10.3', '10.2', '10.1.1', '10.1']\n## NetBackup for VMware best practices\n\nThe following are best practices for NetBackup for VMware:\n\n  * For a more efficient backup, the NetBackup media server and the VMware backup host should be installed on the same host. * When creating virtual machines, use the same name for both host name and display name. If the policy's Primary VM identifier option is changed, the existing entries on the policy Clients tab still work. * VMware recommends that you run no more than four simultaneous backups of virtual machines that reside on the same datastore. * Successful VMware snapshots depend on the following:\n\n    * The amount of I/O that occurs on the virtual machine datastore. Backups should be scheduled when relatively little I/O activity is expected. Reducing the number of simultaneous backups can also help. Limit access to the datastore per policy: Use the Limit jobs per policy\nattribute in the NetBackup policy. Limit access to the datastore globally (across all policies): Use the Host\nProperties Resource Limit screen. See [Setting global limits on the use of VMware resources](v47183490 \"Setting\nglobal limits on the use of VMware resources\"). * The design of the I/O substructure that is associated with each virtual machine datastore. For correct I/O design and implementation, consult your VMware documentation. * Make sure that the VMware backup host has enough memory to handle the number of simultaneous backups that occur. * Include in a single NetBackup policy those virtual machines that use the same datastore. This practice lets you control the amount of backup-related I/O that occurs per datastore, to limit the backup effect on the target virtual machines. * NetBackup supports multiple backup hosts. When a single backup host is saturated with a backup process, another backup host can be added to increase backup throughput. * If a VM's disks are accessible to multiple ESX hosts, the disks can be accessed for backup or restore through any of the ESX hosts. The ESX host may or may not be the ESX host where the virtual machine is running or registered. All of the following must be accessible to each other and should have DNS configured:\n\n    * The vCenter server. * All ESX hosts under the vCenter that have access to the VM's vmdk files.\n\ntitle: NetBackup for VMware sizing and best practices\nurl: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/doc/21414900-146141073-0/v147838584-146141073\ncollection_title: NetBackup&#x2122; Backup Planning and Performance Tuning Guide\nproduct_version: ['10.0', '9.1.0.1', '9.1', '9.0.0.1', '9.0', '8.3.0.2', '8.3.0.1', '8.3']\n## NetBackup for VMware sizing and best practices\n\nIntroduction\n\nNetBackup for VMware provides backup and restore of VMware virtual machines\n(VMs) that run in a vSphere environment.

Maximum fragment size |  For normal backups, NetBackup breaks each backup image into fragments so it does not exceed the maximum file size that the file system allows. You can enter a value from 20 MBs to 51200 MBs. For a FlashBackup policy, Veritas recommends that you use the default, maximum fragment size to ensure optimal deduplication performance. For more information, see the _NetBackup NAS Administrator's Guide_ and the _NetBackup Snapshot Manager for Data Center Administrator's Guide_. Maximum concurrent jobs |  The Maximum concurrent jobs setting specifies the maximum number of jobs that NetBackup can send to a disk storage unit at one time. (Default: one job. The job count can range from 0 to 256.) This setting corresponds to the Maximum concurrent write drives setting for a Media Manager storage unit. NetBackup queues jobs until the storage unit is available. If three backup jobs are scheduled and Maximum concurrent jobs is set to two, NetBackup starts the first two jobs and queues the third job. If a job contains multiple copies, each copy applies toward the Maximum concurrent jobs count. Maximum concurrent jobs controls the traffic for backup and duplication jobs but not restore jobs. The count applies to all servers in the storage unit, not per server. If you select multiple media servers in the storage unit and 1 for Maximum concurrent jobs, only one job runs at a time. The number to enter depends on the available disk space and the server's ability to run multiple backup processes. Warning: A Maximum concurrent jobs setting of 0 disables the storage unit. Use WORM| This option is enabled for storage units that are WORM capable.WORM\nis the acronym for Write Once Read Many.Select this option if you want the\nbackup images on this storage unit to be immutable and indelible until the\nWORM Unlock Time.

Therefore, a storage full condition is\ntriggered at a 96-percent threshold. If you use separate storage for the\ndeduplication database, NetBackup still uses the 96-percent threshold to\nprotect the data storage from any possible overload. If your storage requirements exceed the capacity of a Media Server\nDeduplication Pool, you can use more than one media server deduplication node.

Provision the storage as follows:\n\nUp to 64 TBs |   \n---|---  \n400 TBs |   \n  \nHow many storage instances you provision depends on your storage requirements\nfor your backups. If your requirements are greater than one deduplication node\ncan accommodate, you can configure more than one node. See [About MSDP deduplication nodes](v95643240 \"About MSDP deduplication\nnodes\"). Optimized duplication and replication can also affect the number of nodes you\nprovision. See [About MSDP optimized duplication and replication](v95643289 \"About MSDP\noptimized duplication and replication\"). Other NetBackup requirements may affect how you provision the storage. See [About MSDP storage and connectivity requirements](v24630236 \"About MSDP\nstorage and connectivity requirements\"). How to provision the storage is beyond the scope of the NetBackup\ndocumentation. Consult the storage vendor's documentation. See [About the NetBackup deduplication destination](v95643889 \"About the\nNetBackup deduplication destination\"). See [Planning your MSDP deployment](v28281708 \"Planning your MSDP\ndeployment\"). Up to 64 TBs of storage\n\nProvision the backup storage so that it appears as a single mount point to the\noperating system. Because the storage requires a directory path, do not use only the root node\n(/) or drive letter (E:\\\\) as the storage path. (That is, do not mount the\nstorage as a root node (/) or a drive letter (E:\\\\). If you use a separate disk volume for the deduplication database, provision a\n1-TB volume on a different mount point than the backup data storage. 400 TBs of storage\n\nNetBackup supports 400 TBs of storage in a single Media Server Deduplication\nPool on certain operating systems. See [About MSDP capacity support and hardware requirements](v25295618 \"About\nMSDP capacity support and hardware requirements\"). Before you configure the MSDP storage server, you must provision the volumes. Each volume must conform to the following items:\n\n  * Formatted with a file system that NetBackup supports for MSDP. The same file system must be used for all volumes. * Reside on a separate disk from the other volumes that you allocate for the MSDP storage. * Mounted on a separate mount point on the computer that you want to use as the MSDP storage server. Veritas recommends that you use a descriptive naming convention for the mount\npoint names. Steps to configure the 400 TB MSDP using 50-TB volumes\n\n  1. Create, format, and mount nine new file systems. One file system must have 1-TB storage space and the other eight file systems must have 50-TB storage space each. 2. Mount the 1-TB file system at **/msdp/cat** and the 50-TB file systems on **/msdp/vol0** , **/msdp/vol1** and so on until each volume is mounted. 3.\n\ntitle: About MSDP performance\nurl: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/doc/25074086-165972818-0/v95643429-165972818\ncollection_title: NetBackup&#x2122; Deduplication Guide\nproduct_version: ['10.5', '10.4', '10.3', '10.2.0.1', '10.2']\n## About MSDP performance\n\nMany factors affect performance, especially the server hardware and the\nnetwork capacity. [Table: MSDP job load performance for an MSDP storage\nserver](v95643429#v25295630 \"Table: MSDP job load performance for an MSDP\nstorage server\") provides information about performance during backup jobs for\na deduplication storage server. The deduplication storage server conforms to\nthe minimum host requirements. Client deduplication or load balancing servers\nare not used. Table: MSDP job load performance for an MSDP storage server\n\nWhen| Description  \n---|---  \nNormal operation |  Normal operation is when all clients have been backed up once. Approximately 15 to 20 jobs can run concurrently and with high performance under the following conditions:\n\n  * The hardware meets minimum requirements. (More capable hardware improves performance.) \n  * No compression. If data is compressed, the CPU usage increases quickly, which reduces the number of concurrent jobs that can be handled. * The deduplication rate is between 50% and 100%. The deduplication rate is the percentage of data already stored so it is not stored again. * The amount of data that is stored is between 30% to 90% of the capacity of the storage. Storage approaches full capacity |  NetBackup maintains the same number of concurrent backup jobs as during normal operation under the following conditions:\n\n  * The hardware meets minimum requirements. (More capable hardware improves performance.) \n  * The amount of data that is stored is between 85% to 90% of the capacity of the storage. However, the average time to complete the jobs increases significantly.\n\ntitle: About MSDP storage and connectivity requirements\nurl: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/doc/25074086-165972818-0/v24630236-165972818\ncollection_title: NetBackup&#x2122; Deduplication Guide\nproduct_version: ['10.5', '10.4', '10.3', '10.2.0.1', '10.2']\n200 MB/sec for enterprise-level performance. ---|---  \n32 to 48 TBs of storage |  200 MB/sec. Veritas recommends that you store the data and the deduplication database on separate disk volumes, each with 200 MB/sec read or write speed. Neither should be stored on the system disk. 48 to 64 TBs of storage |  250 MB/sec. Veritas recommends that you store the data and the deduplication database on separate disk volumes, each with 250 MB/sec read or write speed. Neither should be stored on the system disk. 96 TBs of storage |  250 MB/sec. 96 TBs of storage require four separate volumes, each with 250 MB/sec read or write speed. You cannot use the system disk of the storage server host for any of the required volumes. 400 TBs of storage |  500 MB/sec  \n  \nLocal disk storage may leave you vulnerable in a disaster. SAN disk can be\nremounted at a newly provisioned server with the same name. When you deploy NetBackup, provide a dedicated file system for the MSDP\nstorage. If the file system is used for MSDP storage is shared with other\napplications, it may result in a performance degradation, and affect the\nreporting of storage utilization. If another application writes an excessive\namount of data, the file system may get full unexpectedly. If storage reaches\n96% of the capacity, the MSDP storage server becomes unavailable for the\nbackup jobs. NetBackup Media Server Deduplication Pool does not support the following\nstorage types for deduplication storage:\n\n  * Network Attached Storage (that is, file based storage protocols) such as CIFS or NFS. * The ZFS file system. The NetBackup compatibility lists are the definitive source for supported\noperating systems, computers, and peripherals. See the compatibility lists\navailable at the following website:\n\n<http://www.netbackup.com/compatibility>\n\nThe storage must be provisioned and operational before you can configure\ndeduplication in NetBackup. See [About provisioning the storage for MSDP](v95644048 \"About provisioning\nthe storage for MSDP\"). Storage connection\n\nThe storage must be direct-attached storage (DAS), internal disks, or\nconnected by a dedicated, low latency storage area network (Fibre Channel or\niSCSI). A storage area network should conform to the following criteria:\n\nLatency |  Maximum 0.1-millisecond latency per round trip. ---|---  \nBandwidth |  Enough bandwidth on the storage network to satisfy your throughput objectives. Veritas supports iSCSI on storage networks with at least 10-Gigabit Ethernet network bandwidth. Veritas recommends the Fibre Channel storage networks with at least 4-Gigabit network bandwidth. HBAs |  The storage server should have an HBA or HBAs dedicated to the storage. Those HBAs must have enough bandwidth to satisfy your throughput objectives.\n\n\n```\n\n# Question\n```\nwhat are the minimum storage performance requirements when configuring an MSDP dis pool\n```"}], "max_output_tokens": 16384}, "judge_responses_create_params": {"input": [{"role": "developer", "content": "You are an expert grader.

The storage server requires enough capability for deduplication\nand for storage management unless you offload some of the deduplication to\nload-balancing servers. [Table: MSDP server minimum requirements](v25295647#v25295651 \"Table: MSDP\nserver minimum requirements\") shows the minimum requirements for MSDP servers. NetBackup deduplication servers are always NetBackup media servers. Processors for deduplication should have a high clock rate and high floating\npoint performance. Furthermore, high throughput per core is desirable. Each\nbackup stream uses a separate core. Intel and AMD have similar performance and perform well on single core\nthroughput. Newer SPARC processors, such as the SPARC64 VII, provide the single core\nthroughput that is similar to AMD and Intel. Alternatively, UltraSPARC T1 and\nT2 single core performance does not approach that of the AMD and Intel\nprocessors. Tests show that the UltraSPARC processors can achieve high\naggregate throughput. However, they require eight times as many backup streams\nas AMD and Intel processors to do so.

If firewalls exist between the various deduplication hosts, you must open the\nrequired ports. Deduplication hosts are the media servers, deduplication storage servers, any\nload balancing servers, and any clients that deduplicate their own data. Note:\n\nMSDP with Client-Direct (client deduplication) and optimized duplication need\nsome ports to be opened. During Client Direct restores, TCP port 1556 must be open between the\nNetBackup client and the primary server. Table: NetBackup deduplication port usage\n\nPort| Usage  \n---|---  \n10082| This is the NetBackup Deduplication Engine (**spoold**) port that is\nused by MSDP. Open this port between:\n\n  * The deduplication client and the storage servers. * The MSDP and the storage servers. 10102| This is the NetBackup Deduplication Manager (**spad**) port that is\nused by MSDP. Open this port between:\n\n  * The deduplication client and the MSDP servers. * The MSDP server and any Additional servers that handle finger printing. Ports 10082 and 10102 (MSDP) must also be open between the media server and\nany storage servers that perform optimized duplications. Note:\n\nIf using Auto Image Replication (AIR) for optimized duplication, TCP ports\n1556, 10082, and 10102 (MSDP) must be open between the NetBackup domains. Note:\n\nFor isolated recovery environment, TCP ports 1556, 10082, and 10102 are\nrequired to be opened only at the NetBackup source domain.\n\ntitle: NetBackup client ports\nurl: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/doc/80731497-164313255-0/v124789636-164313255\ncollection_title: NetBackup&#x2122; Network Ports Reference Guide\nproduct_version: ['10.4', '10.3', '10.2', '10.1.1', '10.0', '9.1', '9.0', '8.3', '8.2', '8.1.2', '8.1.1', '8.1']\n## NetBackup client ports\n\nThe client requires access to the primary server to initiate user and client-\ninitiated operations such as application backups for Oracle and SQL Server. When using the client-side deduplication, the client must also be able to\ncommunicate with the MSDP media servers. The following table lists the ports required by the client:\n\nTable: NetBackup client ports\n\nSource| Destination| Service| Port  \n---|---|---|---  \nClient| Master server| VERITAS_PBX| 1556  \nClient| Master server| VNETD| 13724 *  \nClient| Media server| VERITAS_PBX| 1556  \nClient| Media server| VNETD| 13724 * *  \nClient| MSDP server| Deduplication Manager (**spad**)| 10102  \nClient| MSDP server| Deduplication Engine (**spoold**)| 10082  \n  \n* It applies while you use the Resilient Network feature or when a NetBackup 8.0 or earlier client cannot reach a legacy service via PBX. ** Required while you use the Resilient Network feature.\n\ntitle: About the NetBackup deduplication destination\nurl: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/doc/25074086-165972818-0/v95643889-165972818\ncollection_title: NetBackup&#x2122; Deduplication Guide\nproduct_version: ['10.5', '10.4', '10.3', '10.2.0.1', '10.2']\n## About the NetBackup deduplication destination\n\nMedia Server Deduplication Pool\n\nA NetBackup Media Server Deduplication Pool represents the disk or cloud\nstorage that is attached to a NetBackup media server. NetBackup deduplicates\nthe data and hosts the storage. If you use this destination, use this guide to plan, implement, configure, and\nmanage deduplication and the storage. When you configure the storage server,\nselect Media Server Deduplication Pool as the storage type. The Media Server Deduplication Pool can be hosted on the following systems:\n\n  * A NetBackup media server. * A NetBackup 5200 series appliance or NetBackup 5300 series appliance.\n\ntitle: About NetBackup Client Direct deduplication\nurl: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/doc/25074086-165972818-0/v24831380-165972818\ncollection_title: NetBackup&#x2122; Deduplication Guide\nproduct_version: ['10.5', '10.4', '10.3', '10.2.0.1', '10.2']\nThe deduplication\nstorage server is a media server on which the deduplication core components\nare enabled.

If firewalls exist between the various deduplication hosts, open the indicated\nports on the deduplication hosts. Deduplication hosts are the deduplication\nstorage server, the load balancing servers, and the clients that deduplicate\ntheir own data. If you have only a storage server and no load balancing servers or clients\nthat deduplicate their own data: you do not have to open firewall ports. Table: Deduplication ports\n\nPort| Usage  \n---|---  \n10082 |  The NetBackup Deduplication Engine (**spoold**). Open this port between the hosts that deduplicate data. Hosts include load balancing servers and the clients that deduplicate their own data. 10102 |  The NetBackup Deduplication Manager (**spad**). Open this port between the hosts that deduplicate data. Hosts include load balancing servers and the clients that deduplicate their own data. 443| Open this port between the MSDP server and the cloud storage target such\nas AWS or Azure.\n\ntitle: NetBackup deduplication ports\nurl: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/doc/80731497-164313255-0/v124789758-164313255\ncollection_title: NetBackup&#x2122; Network Ports Reference Guide\nproduct_version: ['10.4']\n## NetBackup deduplication ports\n\nThe following table shows the ports that are used for NetBackup deduplication\nthat includes Media Server Deduplication (MSDP), and optimized deduplication. If firewalls exist between the various deduplication hosts, you must open the\nrequired ports. Deduplication hosts are the media servers, deduplication storage servers, any\nload balancing servers, and any clients that deduplicate their own data. Note:\n\nMSDP with Client-Direct (client deduplication) and optimized duplication need\nsome ports to be opened. During Client Direct restores, TCP port 1556 must be open between the\nNetBackup client and the primary server. Table: NetBackup deduplication port usage\n\nPort| Usage  \n---|---  \n10082| This is the NetBackup Deduplication Engine (**spoold**) port that is\nused by MSDP. Open this port between:\n\n  * The deduplication client and the storage servers. * The MSDP and the storage servers. 10102| This is the NetBackup Deduplication Manager (**spad**) port that is\nused by MSDP. Open this port between:\n\n  * The deduplication client and the MSDP servers. * The MSDP server and any Additional servers that handle finger printing. Ports 10082 and 10102 (MSDP) must also be open between the media server and\nany storage servers that perform optimized duplications. Note:\n\nIf using Auto Image Replication (AIR) for optimized duplication, TCP ports\n1556, 10082, and 10102 (MSDP) must be open between the NetBackup domains. Note:\n\nFor isolated recovery environment, TCP ports 1556, 10082, and 10102 are\nrequired to be opened only at the NetBackup source domain.\n\ntitle: NetBackup client ports\nurl: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/doc/80731497-164313255-0/v124789636-164313255\ncollection_title: NetBackup&#x2122; Network Ports Reference Guide\nproduct_version: ['10.4', '10.3', '10.2', '10.1.1', '10.0', '9.1', '9.0', '8.3', '8.2', '8.1.2', '8.1.1', '8.1']\n## NetBackup client ports\n\nThe client requires access to the primary server to initiate user and client-\ninitiated operations such as application backups for Oracle and SQL Server. When using the client-side deduplication, the client must also be able to\ncommunicate with the MSDP media servers. The following table lists the ports required by the client:\n\nTable: NetBackup client ports\n\nSource| Destination| Service| Port  \n---|---|---|---  \nClient| Master server| VERITAS_PBX| 1556  \nClient| Master server| VNETD| 13724 *  \nClient| Media server| VERITAS_PBX| 1556  \nClient| Media server| VNETD| 13724 * *  \nClient| MSDP server| Deduplication Manager (**spad**)| 10102  \nClient| MSDP server| Deduplication Engine (**spoold**)| 10082  \n  \n* It applies while you use the Resilient Network feature or when a NetBackup 8.0 or earlier client cannot reach a legacy service via PBX. ** Required while you use the Resilient Network feature.\n\ntitle: About the NetBackup deduplication destination\nurl: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/doc/25074086-165972818-0/v95643889-165972818\ncollection_title: NetBackup&#x2122; Deduplication Guide\nproduct_version: ['10.5', '10.4', '10.3', '10.2.0.1', '10.2']\n## About the NetBackup deduplication destination\n\nMedia Server Deduplication Pool\n\nA NetBackup Media Server Deduplication Pool represents the disk or cloud\nstorage that is attached to a NetBackup media server. NetBackup deduplicates\nthe data and hosts the storage. If you use this destination, use this guide to plan, implement, configure, and\nmanage deduplication and the storage. When you configure the storage server,\nselect Media Server Deduplication Pool as the storage type.

If firewalls exist between the various deduplication hosts, you must open the\nrequired ports. Deduplication hosts are the media servers, deduplication storage servers, any\nload balancing servers, and any clients that deduplicate their own data. Note:\n\nMSDP with Client-Direct (client deduplication) and optimized duplication need\nsome ports to be opened. During Client Direct restores, TCP port 1556 must be open between the\nNetBackup client and the primary server. Table: NetBackup deduplication port usage\n\nPort| Usage  \n---|---  \n10082| This is the NetBackup Deduplication Engine (**spoold**) port that is\nused by MSDP. Open this port between:\n\n  * The deduplication client and the storage servers. * The MSDP and the storage servers. 10102| This is the NetBackup Deduplication Manager (**spad**) port that is\nused by MSDP. Open this port between:\n\n  * The deduplication client and the MSDP servers. * The MSDP server and any Additional servers that handle finger printing. Ports 10082 and 10102 (MSDP) must also be open between the media server and\nany storage servers that perform optimized duplications. Note:\n\nIf using Auto Image Replication (AIR) for optimized duplication, TCP ports\n1556, 10082, and 10102 (MSDP) must be open between the NetBackup domains. Note:\n\nFor isolated recovery environment, TCP ports 1556, 10082, and 10102 are\nrequired to be opened only at the NetBackup source domain.\n\ntitle: NetBackup client ports\nurl: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/doc/80731497-164313255-0/v124789636-164313255\ncollection_title: NetBackup&#x2122; Network Ports Reference Guide\nproduct_version: ['10.4', '10.3', '10.2', '10.1.1', '10.0', '9.1', '9.0', '8.3', '8.2', '8.1.2', '8.1.1', '8.1']\n## NetBackup client ports\n\nThe client requires access to the primary server to initiate user and client-\ninitiated operations such as application backups for Oracle and SQL Server. When using the client-side deduplication, the client must also be able to\ncommunicate with the MSDP media servers. The following table lists the ports required by the client:\n\nTable: NetBackup client ports\n\nSource| Destination| Service| Port  \n---|---|---|---  \nClient| Master server| VERITAS_PBX| 1556  \nClient| Master server| VNETD| 13724 *  \nClient| Media server| VERITAS_PBX| 1556  \nClient| Media server| VNETD| 13724 * *  \nClient| MSDP server| Deduplication Manager (**spad**)| 10102  \nClient| MSDP server| Deduplication Engine (**spoold**)| 10082  \n  \n* It applies while you use the Resilient Network feature or when a NetBackup 8.0 or earlier client cannot reach a legacy service via PBX. ** Required while you use the Resilient Network feature.\n\ntitle: About the NetBackup deduplication destination\nurl: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/doc/25074086-165972818-0/v95643889-165972818\ncollection_title: NetBackup&#x2122; Deduplication Guide\nproduct_version: ['10.5', '10.4', '10.3', '10.2.0.1', '10.2']\n## About the NetBackup deduplication destination\n\nMedia Server Deduplication Pool\n\nA NetBackup Media Server Deduplication Pool represents the disk or cloud\nstorage that is attached to a NetBackup media server.

The storage server requires enough capability for deduplication\nand for storage management unless you offload some of the deduplication to\nload-balancing servers. [Table: MSDP server minimum requirements](v25295647#v25295651 \"Table: MSDP\nserver minimum requirements\") shows the minimum requirements for MSDP servers. NetBackup deduplication servers are always NetBackup media servers. Processors for deduplication should have a high clock rate and high floating\npoint performance. Furthermore, high throughput per core is desirable. Each\nbackup stream uses a separate core. Intel and AMD have similar performance and perform well on single core\nthroughput. Newer SPARC processors, such as the SPARC64 VII, provide the single core\nthroughput that is similar to AMD and Intel. Alternatively, UltraSPARC T1 and\nT2 single core performance does not approach that of the AMD and Intel\nprocessors. Tests show that the UltraSPARC processors can achieve high\naggregate throughput. However, they require eight times as many backup streams\nas AMD and Intel processors to do so. Table: MSDP server minimum requirements\n\nComponent| Storage server| Load-balancing server  \n---|---|---  \nCPU |  Veritas recommends at least a 2.2-GHz clock rate.

Note:\n\nS3 interface for MSDP is not supported on SUSE Linux Enterprise. * It's recommended that the storage server has more than 64 GB of memory and 8 CPUs. * Ensure that NGINX is installed in the storage server. * The NGINX version must be same as the one in the corresponding official RHEL version release.\n\ntitle: Verify that the MSDP server has sufficient memory\nurl: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/doc/25074086-165972818-0/v27541271-165972818\ncollection_title: NetBackup&#x2122; Deduplication Guide\nproduct_version: ['10.5', '10.4', '10.3', '10.2.0.1', '10.2']\nIf you\nhave operation issues, you should verify that your storage server has\nsufficient memory.
