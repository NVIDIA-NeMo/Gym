# NeMo Gym Tutorials

A progressive learning path for building AI agents with NeMo Gym.

## Getting Started

These four tutorials provide everything you need to understand and use NeMo Gym effectively:

### **[01 - Understanding Core Concepts](01-concepts.md)**
Learn the three core building blocks: Models, Resources, and Agents. Understand how they work together to create AI agent systems.

*Prerequisites: None*

### **[02 - Setup and Installation](02-setup.md)** 
Get NeMo Gym installed and servers running with your first successful agent interaction.

*Prerequisites: Python 3.12+, OpenAI API key*

### **[03 - Your First Agent](03-your-first-agent.md)**
Understand how your weather agent works and learn to interact with it. Break down the agent workflow step-by-step and experiment with different inputs.

*Prerequisites: Completed setup tutorial*

### **[04 - Verifying Agent Results](04-verifying-results.md)**
Understand how NeMo Gym evaluates agent performance and what verification means for training. Learn about different verification patterns and how they drive agent improvement.

*Prerequisites: Basic understanding of agent workflow*

## Advanced Topics (In-Progress, More Coming Soon)

### **[05 - Building Custom Resource Servers](05-building-custom-resources.md)**
*Coming soon* - Learn to create your own tools and verification systems.

### **[06 - Debugging Agent Behaviors](06-debugging-agents.md)**
*Coming soon* - Troubleshoot agent workflows, identify issues, and optimize performance.

### **[07 - Integration with External Services](07-external-services.md)**
*Coming soon* - Connect to real APIs, databases, and external systems beyond mock implementations.

### **[08 - Multi-step Multi-turn Interactions](08-multi-step-interactions.md)**
*Coming soon* - Handle complex agent behaviors across multiple conversation turns.

### **[09 - Testing Your Components](09-testing.md)**
*Coming soon* - Ensure reliability and correctness of your custom components.

### **[10 - Configuration Management](10-configuration-guide.md)**
Master NeMo Gym's flexible configuration system to handle different environments, secrets, and deployment scenarios. Learn the three-tier configuration hierarchy and practical patterns for development, testing, and production.

*Prerequisites: Completed basic tutorials*

### **[11 - Data Generation for SFT/DPO](11-data-generation.md)**
*Coming soon* - Collect agent interactions to generate training data for supervised fine-tuning and DPO.

### **[12 - Reinforcement Learning Training](12-rl-training.md)**
*Coming soon* - Connect NeMo Gym with RL frameworks for online agent training and improvement.

### **[13 - Deployment Patterns](13-deployment.md)**
*Coming soon* - Production considerations, scaling strategies, and deployment best practices.

### **[14 - Performance & Scaling](14-performance-scaling.md)**
*Coming soon* - Profile, optimize, and scale your agent systems for high-throughput scenarios.
