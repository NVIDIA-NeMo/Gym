# NeMo Gym Tutorials

A progressive learning path for building AI agents with NeMo Gym.

## Getting Started

### **[01 - Understanding Core Concepts](01-concepts.md)**
Learn the three core building blocks: Models, Resources, and Agents. Understand how they work together to create AI agent systems.

### **[02 - Setup and Installation](02-setup.md)** 
Get NeMo Gym installed and servers running with your first successful agent interaction.

### **[03 - Your First Agent](03-your-first-agent.md)**
Understand how your weather agent works and learn to interact with it. Break down the agent workflow step-by-step and experiment with different inputs.

## Basics

### **[04 - Verifying Agent Results](04-verifying-results.md)**
Understand how NeMo Gym evaluates agent performance and what verification means for training. Learn about different verification patterns and how they drive agent improvement.

### **[05 - Rollout Generation Fundamentals](05-rollout-generation.md)**
Master NeMo Gym's rollout generation system - the foundation for understanding agent behavior, creating training data, and evaluating performance. Learn to systematically capture complete agent interactions.

### **[06 - Offline Training with Rollouts (SFT/DPO)](06-offline-training.md)**
Use generated rollouts to create training data for supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Learn data preparation and quality filtering.

### **[07 - Online Training with Rollouts (RL)](07-online-training.md)**
*Coming soon* - Connect NeMo Gym with RL frameworks for online agent training and improvement. Learn real-time rollout generation and integration with reinforcement learning systems.

## Advanced Topics (In-Progress, More Coming Soon)

### **[08 - Configuration Management](08-configuration-guide.md)**
Master NeMo Gym's flexible configuration system to handle different environments, secrets, and deployment scenarios. Learn the three-tier configuration hierarchy and practical patterns for development, testing, and production.

### **[09 - Building Custom Resource Servers](09-custom-resources.md)**
*Coming soon* - Learn to create your own tools and verification systems.

### **[10 - Integration with External Services](10-external-services.md)**
*Coming soon* - Connect to real APIs, databases, and external systems beyond mock implementations.

### **[11 - Debugging Agent Behaviors](11-debugging-agents.md)**
*Coming soon* - Troubleshoot agent workflows, identify issues, and optimize performance.

### **[12 - Multi-step Multi-turn Interactions](12-multi-step-interactions.md)**
*Coming soon* - Handle complex agent behaviors across multiple conversation turns.

### **[13 - Testing Your Components](13-testing.md)**
*Coming soon* - Ensure reliability and correctness of your custom components.

### **[14 - Deployment Patterns](14-deployment.md)**
*Coming soon* - Production considerations, scaling strategies, and deployment best practices.

### **[15 - Performance & Scaling](15-performance-scaling.md)**
*Coming soon* - Profile, optimize, and scale your agent systems for high-throughput scenarios.
