## Overview

GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) is an online reinforcement learning algorithm that:

- Uses automatic verification to compute rewards
- Trains directly from agent interactions
- Optimizes for task success rates
- Works best with verifiable outcomes

## Quick Start

Coming soon.
