# Get Started with NeMo Gym

**Estimated Time**: 25-30 minutes

This tutorial is designed for those new to reinforcement learning (RL) with large language models, walking you through the complete journey from installation to generating training data at scale.

**By the end of this tutorial series, you will have:**

✅ A working NeMo Gym installation with servers running  
✅ Hands-on experience with agent workflows and tool usage  
✅ Understanding of how verification drives agent improvement  
✅ Ability to generate rollouts for RL training
