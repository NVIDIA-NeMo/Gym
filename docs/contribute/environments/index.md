:gutter: 1 1 1 2

:::{grid-item-card} {octicon}`server;1.5em;sd-mr-1` New Environments
:link: new-environment
:link-type: doc
Build novel training environments for coding, reasoning, tool use, games, and more.

:::

:::{grid-item-card} {octicon}`package;1.5em;sd-mr-1` Verifiers Environments
:link: /tutorials/verifiers-environments
:link-type: doc
Use pre-built environments from Prime Intellect's Environments Hub.
