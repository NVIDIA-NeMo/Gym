## What Are Resources?

Resources are reference materials designed for quick lookup rather than sequential reading. Unlike tutorials (learning-oriented) or concepts (understanding-oriented), resources provide:

- **Quick definitions** - Find terminology fast
- **Reference tables** - Compare options and patterns
- **Checklists** - Verify configurations and setups
- **Examples** - Common patterns and code snippets
