# Single-agent-turn environment server

This Environment Server runs one agent turn against one Resources Server.
It seeds the Resources and agent sessions, plus a session on each configured tool server, grants configured task-scoped tool access and any sandbox access returned by Resources to the agent, invokes `/v1/responses` once, verifies the response, and closes every session it seeded.

`resources_server` is required and belongs to the Environment Server. Configuration resolution follows an unambiguous top-level `_inherit_from` rename of that Resources Server. Copies and multiple destinations require an explicit binding in the child Environment Server; the agent's own binding does not choose it. See the [configuration migration guide](../../fern/versions/latest/pages/troubleshooting/configuration.mdx#move-a-simple_agent-off-the-relay).

Use this server when one agent turn produces the response that Resources verifies.
Other interaction patterns should define their own task input, episode result, and Environment Server implementation.

### Verifier-requested activations

An existing Resources verifier can request bounded follow-up activations without introducing another Environment
Server. This is disabled by default. Enable it explicitly on `single_agent_turn` or `single_agent_turn_legacy`:

```yaml
verifier_continuation:
  max_activations: 6
```

`max_activations` must be between 1 and 32. Resources and tool-server sessions stay open for the episode. Each
activation uses a fresh agent session, and its close must explicitly confirm cleanup before verification runs.
The verifier's optional `next_agent_request` is a complete, standard Responses request for the next activation;
its absence ends the episode. Only the trusted verifier controls this field. An intermediate prefix may be masked
while requesting another activation; it is not recorded as the episode's final score. No continuation request is
sent to a harness, and the environment does not resend a failed agent activation.

The verifier receives the current activation's request and response. The task identity, task data and agent context
stay unchanged. The final result retains the original `responses_create_params`, the verifier's final response,
all distinct agent observations, trajectories and verifier receipts, and usage summed over newly returned activations.
Missing usage stays unknown. `agent_activations` and `verifier_calls` report how many completed calls ran.

If the verifier still requests another activation at the limit, the episode is masked with
`single_agent_turn:continuation_limit` and an incomplete response, rather than scoring the undecided prefix.
The final result omits `next_agent_request`. This mode requires verification and cannot be combined with
`skip_verification`. It marks the episode for restart before creating sessions; cross-round checkpoint restoration
is not supported. The default single-activation protocol retains its existing checkpoint behavior.

`/verify` receives the Resources Server's own flat verify body, the same one an Agent's `/run` sends: the task's `task_data` fields, `responses_create_params`, and the agent's `response`. The request carries the Resources session cookie from seeding, which identifies the episode, so an existing Resources Server verifies these episodes without changes. The verify response becomes the episode result, with the agent's session observations added as `ng_agent_observations`.

Set `forward_agent_evidence: true` when the Resources verifier needs execution evidence, such as tool-use reward shaping. It defaults to `false`. When enabled, `/verify` also receives the available `ng_trajectory` and `ng_agent_observations`. This setting only controls the verifier request; saved episode results retain that evidence with either value.

```yaml
environment_servers:
  single_agent_turn:
    forward_agent_evidence: true
```

Set `skip_verification: true` to return `skip_verification_reward` (default `0.0`) without calling `/verify`, for example for data generation or infrastructure-only runs. The result keeps the flat shape: the verify body, the fixed `reward`, and `verification_skipped: true`, so anything reading the result can tell it from a measured reward. Every session is still closed, and `/aggregate_metrics` skips the Resources Server and reports performance metrics only: `perf_summary`, per-repeat token statistics, and their across-repeat statistics, with confidence intervals for two or more repeats, computed from each rollout's `ng_perf`. Quality metrics such as `mean/reward` are omitted. When the Environment Server leaves either field unset, it uses the bound agent's value, which Gym fills from the global `skip_verification` and `skip_verification_reward` flags. A pairing moved off the `legacy_agent` relay therefore keeps the setting its agent's `/run` honored. This applies to every bound agent, so the global flag also skips verification for agents whose own `/run` never read it:

```yaml
environment_servers:
  single_agent_turn:
    skip_verification: true
    skip_verification_reward: 1.0
```

Resources tool access is opt-in. Set `resources_tool_transports` on the Environment Server deployment to any combination of `direct_http` and `mcp`. Leave it empty when the agent should receive no Resources tools:

```yaml
environment_servers:
  single_agent_turn:
    resources_tool_transports:
      - direct_http
      - mcp
```

`direct_http` grants the Agent Server scoped HTTP access to the Resources Server. `mcp` requires the Resources seed response to provide HTTP MCP connection metadata. Selecting neither transport grants no tools from the episode's Resources Server; `tool_servers` can still add MCP grants. When neither source adds a grant, the Environment Server sends `tool_accesses=[]` when the agent session is seeded.

To grant tools from other Resources servers as well, such as a search server, list them in `tool_servers`. Each episode seeds its own session on every listed server, with the episode's task data, grants that server's MCP tools as a required `MCPToolAccess`, and closes the session at cleanup. A listed server must be a Resources server that exposes its tools over MCP (`expose_tools_over_mcp: true`), and it cannot be the episode's own Resources server, whose tools `resources_tool_transports: [mcp]` grants. The Environment Server does not start otherwise. Unset, `tool_servers` falls back to the bound agent's own `tool_servers`, so an agent moved off the `legacy_agent` relay keeps the tool servers its `/run` seeded; set it to `[]` to grant none:

```yaml
environment_servers:
  single_agent_turn:
    tool_servers:
      - type: resources_servers
        name: tavily
```

With partial-rollout checkpointing on, the agent of an episode that grants `mcp` access or any tool server holds an MCP session token that names the episode's attempt, and the Resources Server refuses that token once a restore replaces the attempt. An episode that grants any tool server restarts from its input after a crash instead of continuing from a checkpoint. One that grants only `mcp` access continues from a checkpoint only if its agent borrows the sandbox the Resources seed lent (`sandbox_access`) and re-binds restored sessions to new tool grants (`rebinds_tool_accesses`, as the OpenCode agent does). Otherwise it restarts from its input.

A restore rebuilds a borrowed sandbox under a new ID. When the replacement attempt continues an episode whose agent had not closed yet, it first seeds the Resources and agent sessions again: the Resources Server returns the restored sandbox, and the agent re-binds its restored session to that sandbox and to the replacement attempt's tool grants, such as a new MCP session token. Seeding again is idempotent, so a checkpoint does not wait for it, and a crash during it seeds again after the next restore. An episode without a borrowed sandbox seeds nothing again.

The server supports `num_workers > 1`. Episode state and cleanup remain local to the worker handling that request. `max_concurrent_episodes` and queue admission are also enforced independently by each worker, so the deployment-wide concurrency limit is approximately `num_workers * max_concurrent_episodes`.
